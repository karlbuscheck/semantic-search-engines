"BREAKING: STARBUCKS CEO To Step Down After Pledge To Hire 10,000 Refugees BACKFIRES","The arrogance of a CEO of a major company like Starbucks, that would put his radical political opinions above the health of the company and the stockholders is astounding. The idea that Howard Schultz believed he could say Starbucks would make hiring 10,000 refugees a priority, while so many Americans are out of work, and it wouldn t harm the Starbucks brand is beyond foolish Howard Schultz, the current CEO of Starbucks, will step down from his role at the giant coffee chain next month.The move comes after his vow to hire thousands refugees in response to President Donald Trump s first travel ban appeared to hurt customer sentiment and dent their sales.Trump supporters have called for a boycott of the chain since January 29, when Schultz vowed to hire 10,000 refugees over five years.Schultz in a letter to employees said the promise of the American Dream was  being called into question  and that  the civility and human rights we have all taken for granted for so long are under attack. He was also a public Clinton supporter and prominent democrat, and even considered as a running mate for the Democratic nominee at one point.Almost immediately consumer perception levels took a hit as measured by YouGov BrandIndex s Buzz score, falling by two-thirds between January 29 and February 13.At the time, analysts at Credit Suisse said the coffee giant s move had a negative impact on recent sales, and could continue to hurt them in the near future.Schultz, with an estimated net worth of $3.1billion, will remain at Starbucks as executive chairman and will focus on strengthening the company s high-end coffee shops.Schultz will be replaced as CEO by Kevin Johnson, Starbucks  chief operating officer, on April 3, 2017, The Seattle Times reported.

"Iranian president defends nuclear deal, says Trump can not undermine it","BEIRUT (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani defended the nuclear deal with Western powers Saturday and said that U.S. President Donald Trump could not undermine it. Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear program in return for the easing of economic sanctions. However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel.  In the nuclear negotiations and agreement we reached issues and benefits that are not reversible. No one can turn that back, not Mr. Trump or anyone else,  Rouhani said at a ceremony at Tehran University marking the start of the university academic year, according to state media.   Even if 10 other Trumps are created in the world, these are not reversible.  Trump, who has called the pact an  embarrassment  and  the worst deal ever negotiated , has been weighing whether the deal serves U.S. security interests as he faces the Oct. 15 deadline for certifying that Iran is complying with its terms.     The prospect of Washington reneging on the deal has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea s nuclear and ballistic missile development. If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. U.N. inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms. Rouhani said Saturday that if the United States violated the deal then it would hurt its own reputation in the international community.  If America carries out any violations today, the whole world will condemn America. They will not condemn Iran,  Rouhani said, according to state media.  Then they will say why did you trust America and sign an agreement with them?  Separately, former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami has been forbidden from attending  public political, cultural and promotional ceremonies , for a period of three months, two of his lawyers told the Iranian Labour News Agency (ILNA) on Saturday. Khatami has long been a lightning rod of criticism for hardliners who accuse him of fomenting unrest in the protests that followed the disputed election of president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2009. Local media are forbidden from quoting Khatami in articles or publishing his image. The new restrictions were issued by Iranian security forces, Khatami s lawyers told ILNA, and there does not appear to be any judicial mechanism to dispute the restrictions. In the lead-up to the presidential election last May, Khatami posted a message online encouraging his supporters to vote for Rouhani. Rouhani made a reference to the new restrictions placed on Khatami during his speech Saturday but did not name him.  If anybody repeats that people should come to the ballot box, they should be punished?  he said, according to ILNA. Khatami s lawyers told ILNA that the restrictions began on the first day of the Iranian month of Mehr, which is Sept. 23.  ",worldnews,"October 7, 2017 ",0
Norway government to rule in minority after centrists abandon talks,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norway s Christian Democratic party withdrew from coalition talks with the government on Wednesday, ending Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg s hopes of broadening her minority right-wing cabinet into a center-right majority one. The move may make it more difficult for Solberg to secure backing for her fiscal spending plans and policy proposals, and could even jeopardize her cabinet s long-term survival. Solberg has ruled in a minority government since 2013 with the populist Progress Party. She had hoped to bring the two parties  other backers in parliament, the Christian Democrats and the Liberals, into her cabinet after the four parties combined won a renewed but smaller majority on Sept. 11. While Solberg had needed the support of just one of the two centrist parties previously to push through her policies, she now needs the backing of both in addition to that of her own Conservatives and the Progress Party. But the Christian Democrats, wary of supporting further tax cuts and the government s tough line on immigration, said it would stay out of government even though it preferred Solberg as prime minister over Labour leader Jonas Gahr Stoere. Solberg had previously rejected a proposal from the Liberals and the Christian Democrats to remove Progress from the government in favor of the centrists.  Our alternative for a government did not succeed, but we still wish for good, constructive cooperation,  party leader Knut Arild Hareide of the Christian Democrats told reporters after meeting the three other parties on Wednesday. The Liberals will continue to negotiate with the government, but their potential inclusion in the cabinet would not be sufficient to ensure a majority. The government is due to present its 2018 fiscal spending proposal on Oct. 12 and must negotiate a compromise in parliament by late November or early December. ",worldnews,"September 27, 2017 ",0

"Motorbike explosion in Syrian city kills child, monitors say","BEIRUT (Reuters) - A booby-trapped motorbike exploded in the northeastern Syrian city of Qamishli on Monday, killing a child and wounding six other people, the monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported. Syrian state TV said a motorbike had exploded and reported that four people were wounded but did not immediately mention deaths. Qamishli is in an area mostly under the control of Kurdish security forces. Bomb blasts, often claimed by Islamic State, have occurred in Qamishli and nearby Hasaka city, both under Kurdish control, but have been rare in the last year. Islamic State also reported the bombing via its online Amaq news agency, saying it had targeted a vehicle belonging to Kurdish security forces. It did not explicitly claim the attack. Kurdish internal security force the Asayish, in a statement, blamed a Syrian government-allied paramilitary group for carrying out the attack. The Kurdish YPG militia is spearheading a U.S.-backed offensive to drive Islamic State out of the jihadist group s remaining strongholds in eastern Syria, including its former de facto Syrian capital, Raqqa. The YPG and Syrian government forces have mostly stayed out of each other s way in the six-year-old Syrian conflict. ",worldnews,"September 18, 2017 ",0

NFL opposes U.S. Republican tax plan on stadium funding,"(Reuters) - The National Football League said on Tuesday it opposes a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans that could force teams to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction. Under the legislation unveiled last week, local governments could no longer fund the building or renovation of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax-exempt, public-purpose bonds, the sort of bonds typically used to fund schools, libraries and public transit. According to the NFL, building new stadiums enhances economic development in cities that are home to the venues and federal tax breaks should be available. “You can look around the country and see the economic development that’s generated from some of these stadiums,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told a conference call. “These sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country, so we will continue to make our opposition known on that.” President Donald Trump has called for an end to the subsidy, at least for the NFL, after some of its players angered the Republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in 2015. A report last year by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based social sciences research group, found that of the 45 major-league stadiums built or overhauled since 2000, 36 were at least partly funded by tax-exempt municipal bonds. The NFL’s Oakland Raiders are expected to begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020 and construction on a new stadium is already underway. Lockhart refused to what, if any, impact the bill could have on the viability of the new stadium. “That is a hypothetical at this point and we’d have to see how the final bill comes out,” he said. “What gets proposed out of the writing committee from the party in control very often is not what is eventually signed into law, so we’ll have to see where that goes.”             ",politicsNews,"November 7, 2017 ",0

Kenyan police fire teargas to break slum protests after four murdered,"NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas to disperse a crowd that was protesting on Sunday against the overnight murder of four people in a slum in the capital Nairobi. Parts of the city have been gripped by tension since Friday when at least five people were killed in violence involving the police and opposition supporters who were accompanying their leader Raila Odinga after a trip abroad.  Japheth Koome, the police commander in the city, said investigations had started after four bodies were found in the Mathare Area Four slum on Sunday morning.   We went there and found those bodies with injuries,  he told a news conference, describing the murders as a criminal act rather than ethnic-driven violence. The violence took place a day before the Supreme Court rules on two cases seeking to nullify the re-election of President Uhuru Kenyatta in a repeat election held last month. Odinga, who successfully petitioned against Kenyatta s initial victory in the Aug. 8 vote and subsequently boycotted the repeat poll, visited the scene of the murders on Sunday and accused the government of being behind the killings.  Those who are doing these acts are the ones who already lost and want to hold onto power by force but we will remove them using the power of the people,  he told a crowd of his supporters. Police fired teargas and used water cannons to disperse protesters for the better part of the morning until calm was restored in the area in the afternoon. The broadcast industry regulator, Communications Authority of Kenya, said it had banned live broadcasts of political rallies, after all the main TV stations showed hours of live footage of the chaos that greeted Odinga s return. A source at the authority told Reuters on Sunday the ban was put in place to help manage the tension in the country. ",worldnews,"November 19, 2017 ",0
Saudi king says kingdom has made progress in tackling terrorism,"MECCA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Saudi King Salman, receiving dignitaries attending the annual Muslim haj pilgrimage, said on Saturday the kingdom had made progress in eradicating terrorism aimed at attacking its holy sites, state news agency SPA reported. Saudi Arabia, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam s holiest sites and organizing the haj, has been hit by bombings in recent years and uncovered plots to carry out attacks in Mecca.  The limbs of terrorism have sought to harm the holy cities, paying no attention to their sanctity,  SPA quoted King Salman as telling foreign dignitaries at a reception he held in Mecca, where more than 2 million pilgrims are performing haj.   But the kingdom, by the grace of God and in cooperation with its sisters and friends, has made big successes in eradicating terrorism and has worked decisively and with determination to dry its sources,  he added, without elaborating. Salman also said Saudi Arabia had devoted all its material and human resources to ensure the safety of pilgrims who come from all over the world to perform the five-day ritual, a religious duty to be undertaken once in a lifetime by every able-bodied Muslim who can afford the journey.  We are determined, with God s permission, to continue to provide the highest level of services for the two holy mosques ... to ensure the safety of those who seek the sacred house of God,  he said. The pilgrimage has frequently been hit by stampedes and fires. In the most recent incident, hundreds of pilgrims were killed in a crush two years ago. ",worldnews,"September 2, 2017 ",0

 Miami Police Union Leader Joins Other Conservatives In Bashing NFL For Las Vegas Massacre,"Over 50 people are dead, and more than 500 are wounded, after a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay on the south end of the Las Vegas strip late last night. And true to form, we re already hearing conservatives use it to push their  moar gunz  and  blue lives matter  agendas while crying that anyone begging Congress to do something real to save lives is  politicizing a tragedy. But the true political agenda comes from those who won t acknowledge that commonsense gun legislation would save lives and think that protesting racial injustice is the same thing as protesting against police officers themselves, the military, and the country. The leader of Miami s chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, Lt. Javier Ortiz, tweeted the following:Two groups of people, one in Seattle, one in Vegas, chose to take action last night in their own way . We support the #POLICE pic.twitter.com/2S8WkpWvXl  Miami FOP 20 (@MiamiFOP20) October 2, 2017When the Miami New Times asked him to clarify, he said: While NFL players express a false perception of police officers by inciting hate and division by disrespecting the U.S. flag, the reality is law enforcement risks their lives every day for America. We don t know the motive behind Stephen Paddock s decision to break open the window of a room at Mandalay Bay and then fire multiple clips of rounds into the crowd attending the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival below. As of now, this doesn t appear to have had anything to do with hatred of police officers and we can t say it did until Paddock s motive is discovered.It s true that mass shootings and really, any crime would be worse if it weren t for the law enforcement officers who risk their lives to stop them, but Lt. Ortiz s remarks are dangerously irresponsible because they could trigger a retaliation from the people who worship the flag and think police brutality against African-Americans isn t a thing.And Ortiz isn t the only one who s slamming the NFL because of Las Vegas.

LAUGHABLE: Clinton Press Secretary Gives Conditions Under Which She Will Give A Press Conference,"From the ABC News report:Hillary Clinton  Will Hold Press Conferences  as President, Press Secretary VowsIt s been 272 days since Hillary Clinton s last press conference. But Clinton s lead press secretary, Brian Fallon, vowed that if elected,  Hillary Clinton will hold press conferences. But the frequency of them is something that would just play out as time went on,  he added.On this week s  Powerhouse Politics  podcast, Fallon promised greater interaction between Clinton and the press on the campaign trail and said he expects the Democratic nominee to hold a press conference soon. The amount of interaction can only go up,  he said, noting that the traveling press will soon be flying with Clinton on her new campaign plane. I m sure that will bring with it a lot of opportunities for additional access to the candidate and interactions between her and the traveling press corps that covers her every day,  Fallon told ABC News  chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, and political director Rick Klein on the podcast. We are very respectful of the press and the job that they have to do,  Fallon continued.  We have done a lot of interviews, but I know that no matter how many questions we answer in a variety of formats, it is the press s job to always demand more access. We respect that, and so we re going to seek further ways to accommodate that in the remaining months of the campaign. Read more: ABC",politics,"Sep 4, 2016",1
"BREAKING: WHY DID OBAMA JUST Break Democrat Ranks, Throw Hillary Under The Bus On FBI Investigation?","Of course, we all know that Obama is not a man of integrity or character. There has to be something in it for him. Did FBI Director James Comey cut a deal with Barack? Why is every other Democrat calling for Comey s head? It s unprecedented for Democrats to break ranks on something this important. Stay tuned President Barack Obama does not believe FBI Director James Comey is attempting to influence this year s presidential vote, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday. The President doesn t believe that he s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party,  Earnest said.  He s in a tough spot, and he s the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions in administrations led by presidents in both parties. The White House had no role in Comey s decision to inform Congress he was investigating new emails related to Hillary Clinton s private server, Earnest added.Earnest said he would neither  defend nor criticize  the decision. He s aiming to preserve the integrity of the review into whether additional emails discovered on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner are relevant to an investigation into Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Earnest said that norms about making information public should be followed.Amid outcry about Comey s decision, Earnest called the FBI director a man of  integrity and good character.

 Trump Makes Startling Admission About His Wife And Run For The White House,"With Donald Trump taking the Republican Party and the nation by storm, it s easy to say that no one really saw him getting as far as he has during this election cycle. And while many of us wish he never threw his name into the ring as a GOP contender, it looks as though we re not the only ones who didn t want him to run.Even though she will be campaigning for him for the first time in Wisconsin this coming week, Melania Trump definitely had her reservations about her husband running in the first place.During an interview with the Washington Post, Trump revealed that Melania wasn t excited about the possibility of him becoming a candidate. According to Trump: She said,  We have such a great life. Why do you want to do this? And in a very Trumpian fashion, Trump responded to her as though he s Superman needed to come to the rescue of the nation: I said,  I sort of have to do it, I think. I really have to do it.  . . . I could do such a great job. But Melania said: I hope you don t do it, but if you run, you ll win. However, Trump being Trump and unable to respect a woman s opinion on pretty much anything, he ignored his wife s wishes to just continue on with their life as usual to be with their son and run his business ventures. Instead, he decided to run for dictator of the universe, or at least that s sure as hell how it seems.It s becoming more clear than ever that Donald Trump is in this election not for the country, but rather for Donald Trump. Within the mind of the narcissist, he believes that he, with no experience whatsoever in political and diplomatic leadership, can take the reins of the United States of America. And while his applause lines may work on the nincompoops within the Republican party for the primary elections, they most certainly will not work in the general election among people who can actually critically think   the Democrats. However, we must make sure he and his imbecilic following doesn t even remotely get the chance to win, so remember   no matter who, vote blue.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"April 3, 2016",1

 The Gay Men Killed In Fl. Shooting Would Not Have Been Able To Donate Blood Today,"Blood donations are urgently needed in the Orlando, Florida area following Saturday night s massacre. So far, 50 people have died in the massacre and at least 53 are hospitalized due to injuries. The shooting took place at Pulse, an LGBT nightclub.The current crisis reveals the incredibly homophobic rules put in place by the FDA regarding blood donations. The FDA s current rules stipulate that any man who has had sex with another man cannot donate blood until they have been celibate for one year. This bars nearly all gay and bisexual men from being able to donate blood.According to reports, One Blood, a blood donation center in Orlando, has temporarily lifted the ban on blood for their organization, allowing men who have had homosexual intercourse donate to their organization. One Blood reports that their blood donation center is currently at capacity. However, they will still need high numbers of donations over the next few days in order to keep replenishing their stock. A tremendous response by blood donors in light of the tragic mass shooting in Orlando. We are asking donors to donate over the next several days to help replenish the blood supply. We are asking people please make an appointment online or call 1.888.9.DONATE (1.888.936.6283). Thank you! As our nation collectively mourns the massive loss of life in Florida, it is a good time for us to look at the institutionalized homophobia that helps to create a culture that determines that LGBT lives and bodies are lesser than that of heteronormative individuals. Right now, the blood of gay and bisexual men, as well as so many others, stains the interior of the Pulse nightclub. Orlando s Mayor Buddy Dyer, described the scene by saying: There s blood everywhere. As far as the FDA is concerned, the blood of those who died on Saturday had no value to living.Blood is thoroughly screened by blood donation organizations no matter who donates to them. There is no need for this discriminatory policy. Nothing should prevent a healthy person from being able to give the gift of saving a life. The horror that occurred on Saturday night proved that gay, bisexual, straight, man, women, black, or white we all bleed and that all life is precious.Featured image from Photo by Tim Matsui/Getty Images",News,"June 12, 2016",1
"Their fortunes enmeshed, Trump and Putin to hold first meeting next week","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin next week at a summit in Germany that brings two world leaders whose political fortunes have become intertwined face-to-face for the first time. Both the Kremlin and the White House announced on Thursday that the pair will meet on the sidelines of the July 7-8 summit of G20 nations in Hamburg. Trump’s national security adviser H.R. McMaster downplayed the significance of the meeting, one of nine such side meetings for the U.S. president over two days. “It won’t be different from our discussions with any other country, really,” McMaster said. “There’s no specific agenda. It’s really going to be whatever the president wants to talk about.” The meeting will be fraught with difficulties for Trump.     Allegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and colluded with the Republican’s campaign have overshadowed the businessman’s unexpected victory and dogged his first five months in office. Russia and the United States are also at odds over Ukraine, NATO expansion and the civil war in Syria where Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad.  The United States backs rebel groups trying to overthrow Assad, and Washington angered Russia by launching missile strikes against a Syrian government air base in April in response to what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians. Trump has frequently called for better ties with Russia but lawmakers in his own Republican Party are urging him to be wary of Moscow. “As the president has made clear, he’d like the United States and the entire West to develop a more constructive relationship with Russia but he has also made clear that we will do what is necessary to confront Russia’s destabilizing behavior,” McMaster said.     U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia hacked and leaked emails of Democratic Party political groups to help Trump win the 2016 U.S. presidential election against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Russia denies the allegations and Trump says his team did not collude with Moscow.     Several congressional committees as well as the FBI are investigating Russia’s role in the election and any alleged collusion by Trump’s campaign. That makes the optics of the Putin meeting particularly challenging for Trump. “If there are big grins on both of their faces, that will be the picture on the front pages of every Western newspaper, as the investigation continues here,” said Heather Conley, a former State Department official in the George W. Bush White House. “I would think the president would be advised, if there is a meeting, to be very careful with his body language,” Conley told Reuters. Trump raised Russian hackles this week when the White House said it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack and warned that Assad and his forces would “pay a heavy price” if it did so. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov warned on Wednesday that Moscow would respond proportionately if the United States took measures against Syrian government forces.     But Lavrov added that it would “probably not be right” if Putin and Trump did not talk at the G20 summit of world economic powers.                Republican Bob Corker, the influential chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, described the planned encounter as “just a side meeting” but said he hoped Trump would bring up problematic issues with Putin. “I would hope what he would do is hand him a list of the issues we have with their country. And I think he may well do that,” Corker told Reuters. Putin, who has served as both Russian president and prime minister, has outlasted the previous two U.S. presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Officials from those administrations say American officials initially overestimated their potential areas of cooperation with the Russian leader. Then, through a combination of overconfidence, inattention and occasional clumsiness, Washington contributed to a deep spiral in relations with Moscow, they say. Those relations reached a post-Cold War low under Trump’s predecessor, Obama. In the last days of his presidency, Obama ordered the expulsion of 35 Russian suspected spies and imposed sanctions on two Russian intelligence agencies over their involvement in hacking U.S. political groups in the 2016 election. A proposed new package of sanctions on Russia in the U.S. Congress might also put curbs on Trump’s ability to pursue warmer relations with Moscow.  The U.S. Senate reached an agreement on Thursday to resolve a technical issue stalling the sanctions, although the measure’s fate in the House of Representatives is uncertain.

EU will cut some money for Turkey as ties sour,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union will cut some of the money earmarked for Turkey to join the bloc, reflecting increasingly sour ties with Ankara but stopping short of killing membership bid of the country it still sees as a strategic partner. The EU has been walking a tight rope for months on Turkey, angered by President Tayyip Erdogan s crackdown on critics after a failed coup in July, 2016, but dependant on Ankara to keep a lid on immigration to Europe and combat militants in Syria.  The EU leaders  chairman, Donald Tusk, said the bloc had agreed in two days of talks in Brussels to cut or reroute some of the 4.4 billion euros ($5.2 bln) Ankara was due to get as part of its accession talks in 2014-20.  It was a substantive discussion. We want to keep the door open to Ankara, but the current reality in Turkey is making this difficult,  Tusk told a news conference. Germany has seen its ties with Turkey particularly strained and Chancellor Angela Merkel called last month for a tougher stance on Ankara as she campaigned for re-election at home.

" Republican Insiders Are Taking Aim At Trump, Calling On Pence To Drop Out","Now that it s been exposed that Donald Trump is a serial pervert who sexually assaults women, Republicans are desperate to get him out of the race and promptly replaced by another GOPer who, you know, doesn t casually admit to forcing himself onto women.Well it s harder said than done. First, the rules make it very hard to remove someone and replace them   especially with four weeks left until the election. Second, Trump has already stated that he would not bow out of the race under any circumstances.Even though dozens of influential Republican lawmakers and figures want him out, they are stuck with him unless he decides to personally call it quits.So what s plan B? Well, for starters, they want Mike Pence to drop off the ticket in an effort to pressure Trump to follow suit.According to CNN s Dana Bash:Sources tell @GloriaBorger some republicans want @mike_pence to quit the ticket in order to pressure @realDonaldTrump to get out  Dana Bash (@DanaBashCNN) October 9, 2016In other words, Republicans are hoping to use Mike Pence as a battering ram to force their pathetic, perverted candidate out of the race and usher in an equally pathetic Hail Mary to save their asses.Republicans   especially those who placed all their hope in Trump   are officially the saddest lot in American politics.After cutting off his cash force, cancelling Mike Pence s campaign stops and publicly denouncing him in stinging rebukes, Republicans realized they couldn t shake him off. So they thought the only way they could do it was to hit him where it hurts   the man who is supposed to be by his side no matter what.Republicans, Donald Trump is your mess. Why should Pence suffer humiliation to save your mistake? Whereas Pence may be a deplorable homophobe and misogynist himself, he didn t put Trump in this position, Trump did.Whether or not Pence will buck Trump and save his 2020 plans remains to be seen. But for the time being, Trump-Pence look to be heading into a general election with Clinton-Kaine, and if the trends and polls seem to be indicator, it s looking great for the latter.Congratulations GOP, you built this.

German court sentences 88-year-old Holocaust denier to jail,"BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court sentenced an 88-year-old woman to six months in prison on Monday for denying the Holocaust and for inciting hatred. Ursula Haverbeck, who describes herself as a revisionist historian, said at a public event in January 2016 that gas chambers in Auschwitz concentration camp  were not real . A court in Berlin found Haverbeck guilty after examining a short video of her speech in which she said that she was citing a book, not expressing her own views. The court, however, found the speech to be her own and gave her six months in prison. Denying the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed, is a crime in Germany, punishable by up to five years in prison. Haverbeck, who is avoiding going to jail by appealing the verdict, has faced similar legal cases across Germany. The latest was by a court in North Rhine-Westphalia last summer when she was given a 10-month prison sentence for the same charges. ",worldnews,"October 17, 2017 ",0
 Charles Koch Does A Brutally Honest Interview The Republican Party Isn’t Gonna Like (VIDEO),"Charles Koch sat down with ABC News and did an interview, during which he said it was  possible  that Hillary Clinton could be a better president than some of the Republicans still left. It was in no way an endorsement of Clinton. It was a well-worded question that elicited a noteworthy and honest response. That 30 seconds of reporting dominated the already slow news cycle while the meat of the Charles Koch interview went largely ignored.Charles Koch doesn t come across as many people think he should. He shows up in sweaters and comfy shoes looking like Mr. Rogers and being extremely passionate about his policy positions. What many people don t understand is that the Koch Brothers, while massive and powerful beyond belief, are Libertarians. Libertarians want taxes gone. They want money out of politics because they think the government should be almost non-existent. In order to achieve this Libertarian Utopia, they first have to conquer the Republican Party, the only people who will give them a flat tax and deregulate everything.Charles Koch admits that he benefits from a  rigged system.  He admits to all the money that is spent on corporate welfare and tax shelters for the wealthy. He admits that cronyism runs our country and he knows that the rich are getting richer and the poor have no chance. If you were to attach Charles Koch s belief system to a liberal set of values you d have Bill Gates meets Warren Buffet. Unfortunately, what you actually end up with is a grandfatherly figure whose sheer power won t be stopped, it ll be chatted about nicely in the den.The Kochs lean to the right on enough issues that their money gets thrown at the Republican party. They want to eliminate the tax code, thinking it will put people on level playing field   or maybe just to keep more profits. They want regulation out of business, so free markets could thrive and regulate themselves   or maybe just to cut corners and save money. They want money out of politics, so they pour money into politics. The Kochs aren t in danger of being aligned with Democrats, but if you listen to Charles tell it, if the Democratic party would come around on just a few things, they would see more Koch money. Yes, that s a ridiculous notion. Charles Koch sits and talks about everyone taking care of one another while it was he and his brother who created the Tea Party and their bigotry and went to work in 2014 to see to it that everyone hated the poor and Ebola enough to vote red.The Kochs have always backed Republicans, an investment Charles calls  disappointing.  He remembers the one time he asked for a political favor to shoot down a bill that was nothing but corporate tax breaks and fewer than 10 percent of the people they backed on the campaign trail came through when it was time to vote. The one time. Somehow it seems unlikely that a man who just confessed to raising half a billion dollars for political purposes has asked for more than one favor, but we ll let Mr. Koch s good character speak for itself (wink, wink).They have apparently gotten tired of the Republican party, at least this time around. Charles is adamant that the mud-slinging ad-hominem festival of stupid that has been the GOP primary has not received a dime from their war chest. Not a single campaign on either side has reaped the benefits of Koch support. The only candidate Koch mentions by name is Bernie Sanders, who he says is at least addressing the issue of the two-tiered system and wealth inequality, though he can t understand his methods. It s difficult for a man who professes to be a  classic liberal  to consider putting the needs of the less fortunate first. If his barn is stocked with horses, his cupboards and refrigerator with food and his home stocked with creature comforts he ll be in a much better position to help those who have struggled.All in all, this interview doesn t bode well for the GOP. They re looking for almost a billion dollars from Koch s PAC, which by his own estimate has only raised $200 million so far this year. The Republican party has certainly shown that it knows how to screw up a free lunch. When you can t do something as simple as keeping your number one source of income in the game, you know the end is near. Featured image from screen capture",News,"April 25, 2016",1

Clinton extends lead over Trump to 8 percentage points: Reuters/Ipsos,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton extended her lead over Republican rival Donald Trump to eight percentage points, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday, from six points on Friday. The bump for Clinton followed the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia last week at which Clinton and her supporters painted an optimistic portrait of America, and came amid controversy over Trump’s comments about the parents of a slain Muslim U.S. soldier. About 43 percent of likely voters favor Clinton, 35 percent favor Trump, and 9 percent picked “Other,” according to the July 28-Aug. 1 online poll of 1,289 likely voters. The poll had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points.  Trump has faced a barrage of criticism in recent days from political allies as well as opponents after he criticized the parents of U.S. Army Captain Humayun Khan, who was killed in Iraq in 2004. The father, Khizr Khan, had harsh words for Trump at the Democratic convention where he spoke on Thursday night, saying the 70-year-old businessman and former reality TV star had “sacrificed nothing and no one” and railing against his calls to ban Muslim immigrants. Trump responded saying Khan “viciously attacked” him, and suggested the man was repeating lines fed to him by the Clinton campaign. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who dropped out of the Republican presidential primary race and endorsed Trump, said on Tuesday that Trump’s criticisms of the Khans was “inappropriate.” House Republican Richard Hanna of New York said it was “not enough to simply denounce his (Trump’s) comments,” and said he would support former Secretary of State Clinton instead. Trump had a short-lived bump in the polls after the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in late July, when Reuters polling showed him slightly ahead of Clinton for the first time since May.

Pakistan raps Trump over vow to free doctor who helped track bin Laden,"ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan angrily criticized Donald Trump, frontrunner for the U.S. Republican presidential nomination, for saying he would force the country to free a jailed Pakistani doctor believed to have helped the CIA hunt down al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Trump, a 69-year-old billionaire real estate developer, told Fox News on Friday that, if elected, he would get Pakistan to free Shakil Afridi “in two minutes”, saying that Islamabad receives a lot of development aid from the United States. “Contrary to Mr. Trump’s misconception, Pakistan is not a colony of the United States of America,” Pakistani Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar said in a statement on Monday. The statement said Afridi’s fate would be decided “by the Pakistani courts and the government of Pakistan and not by Mr. Donald Trump, even if he becomes the president of the United States”. The statement came on the fifth anniversary of the killing of bin Laden - architect of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on U.S. cities - during a secret raid in the Pakistani town of Abbottabad that damaged relations between the strategic allies. Washington views Afridi as a hero but Pakistan sentenced him in 2012 to 33 years in jail on charges of belonging to militant group Lashkar-e-Islam, which he denies. That sentence was overturned and Afridi is now awaiting trial on another charge. Trump has alarmed U.S. allies with his combative rhetoric and his calls for an “America First” agenda that many see as a threat to retreat from the world. In his comments about Pakistan and Afridi for Fox News, Trump said: “I would tell them let (him) out and I’m sure they would let (him) out. Because we give a lot of aid to Pakistan.” Afridi has also been accused in Pakistan of running a fake vaccination campaign in which he purportedly collected DNA samples to help the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) track down bin Laden. He has not been charged over those allegations. After his original conviction was overturned, he was charged in 2013 with murder relating to the death of a patient eight years earlier. He remains in jail. In the Fox interview Trump also said he supported leaving the roughly 10,000 U.S. troops still based in Afghanistan instead of withdrawing them by the end of 2017. “I would stay in Afghanistan,” he said. “It’s probably the one place we should have gone in the Middle East because it’s adjacent and right next to Pakistan which has nuclear weapons.” The United States led the military invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 to oust the Taliban for sheltering bin Laden and other al Qaeda leaders following the Sept. 11 attacks.

WATCH VIOLENT RIOTS BREAK OUT: German Citizens Panic! Citizens Fight Back Against Muslim Refugee “Caliphate” [Video],"Make no mistake about it America is next! German police were forced to turn water cannons on far-left  anti-fascists  staging a violent counter demonstration at an anti-Islamisation rally on Sunday.Authorities initially tried to have the demonstration, organised by the anti-Islamisation group Hooligans Against Salafists (HOGESA), banned. However, a court dismissed the motion and ruled that protesters would be allowed to gather at a fixed location, but not to march through the streets of Cologne, in western Germany.Police deployed 3,500 officers wearing riot gear, with water cannons and a helicopter at the ready, as they expected up to 23,000 to attend the demonstration and counter demonstration, Bild reports.Proceedings began at around 2:00pm, with the HOGESA demonstrators kettled on a dirt lot between Cologne s Deutz station and trade fair. They were surrounded by the far left  anti fascists  chanting slogans like  No human is illegal  and  Open the borders! As the afternoon progressed the left wing counter demonstration became increasingly aggressive, with a number of  anti-fascists  attempting to cross police lines and reach the HOGESA demonstrators. They were finally dispersed with the water cannons.Swiss police were forced to use water cannon on pro-mass migration  anti-fascists  in the city of Bern last weekend. Demonstrators turned out to protest the anti-mass migration Swiss People s Party winning the national election, with some turning violent.A shocking new video provides more reason for non-Muslims in the West to worry about the ongoing refugee crisis in the Middle East. A Muslim cleric and leader was recently explaining what was really going on with the mass Muslim migration when he got a bit too honest with the crowd. The infidels want us to be tormented. They want us to be humiliated. The Koran says:  The Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you,  but we will never follow their religion. This dark night will be over, and soon, we will trample them underfoot, Allah willing.Germany is not a compassionate country that wishes to absorb refugees from Syria and Iraq, and Palestinian refugees in the Levant and elsewhere. Europe has become old and decrepit, and needs human reinforcement.No force is more powerful than the human force of us Muslims. Oh, Muslims, the Germans say, in their economic reports, that they need 50,000 young workers. Now, they have got 20,000, and they want another 30,000 and more, to work in their factories.They are not motivated by compassion for the Levant, its people, and its refugees.

UPDATE ON 9/11 MEMORIAL Banned for “Triggering” College Snowflakes,"Great news! Southern Methodist University in Texas has reversed its decision to relocate an annual 9/11 memorial display made up of nearly 3,000 American flags to a less prominent part of campus after facing backlash from student groups.A huge thank you to The Young Americans for Freedom group! They had a hand in making this happen! They also were the ones who had set up the tribute honoring the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on SMU s Dallas Hall Lawn every year since 2010.But in July officials informed the group to move the display to Morrison-McGinnis Park because Dallas Hall Lawn is used for classes and a variety of events, said university spokesman Kent Best.SMU officials also had adopted a policy to ensure displays didn t include  harmful or triggering  messages, but they later removed the language from the then-policy as inappropriate. By that time, though, some student groups said the new policy was an attack on free speech. I don t believe it s the responsibility of the university to shield individuals from certain ideas that they might be offended by,  said Grant Wolf, the leader of the Young Americans for Freedom group, according to Dallas News. Wolf, along with other leaders from campus groups, sent a letter to university President R. Gerald Turner to express their frustration with the policy.  People absolutely have to have a right to their own opinions, but this does not come with a right to be shielded from opposing ideas, especially in an environment dedicated to the learning, sharing and developing of new ideas,  they wrote.They decried the relocation of the memorial. Moving the 9/11 memorial to an out of the way park is almost the same as not allowing it, said Heather Hall, president of the university s Turning Point USA chapter.  That s not free speech,  Hall said.  That s not American. That s definitely not what SMU stands for.   Read more:  Daily MailOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THIS BAN: The shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed. The inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in American tolerance these days. It s so ironic that the left wants you to march to their drum beat or else they will destroy you. Note to SMU: You had a good thing going with your student body coming together to memorialize 9/11 so let it continue!DALLAS, Tex.   In a time of extreme political divide, students both Republican and Democrat at one Texas college have found something they can agree on.For the past two years at Southern Methodist University, a campus group has planted thousands of American flags in front of Dallas Hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks. That s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech,  said Grant Wolf, the Young Americans for Freedom Chairman.But in July, SMU changed its policy, saying student groups can no longer have displays there.The lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations. The leaders of two prominent student groups say the policy violates their right to free speech. They re basically cornering us into a segment of campus and saying you re not allowed to have a display here because it s triggering, harmful or offensive to students over there,  said Drew Wicker, the President of SMU College Republicans.SMU released a statement saying nearby Momac Park, where displays will be allowed, is larger than the lawn and is along one of the most prominent drives on campus.The university said it  respects the rights of all campus community members to express their opinions, as well as their right to be free from coercion or harassment.

"As Russia probe grinds on, Trump struggles to gain traction on agenda","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The investigation into alleged ties between President Donald Trump’s election campaign and Russia is threatening to dampen already flagging momentum for the president’s legislative agenda of rolling back Obamacare and overhauling the tax code.  With the Senate convening on Monday and the House of Representatives on Tuesday for a legislative sprint leading up to an August recess, the spotlight is on James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump on May 9. Comey, who will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, will be grilled on whether Trump tried to get him to back off an investigation into alleged ties between the president’s 2016 campaign and Russia. Trump, a Republican, has called the Russia probe a “witch hunt” designed to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. The Russia matter presents a double-barreled threat to congressional Republicans: It could impede healthcare and tax initiatives that already were languishing and it could hurt efforts to hold onto their majorities in the House and Senate in 2018 midterm elections. “It’s an enormous distraction and it creates uncertainty,” said veteran Republican Representative Tom Cole in a telephone interview. “It casts a pall over the political system and slows things down. You don’t want to slow things down when you have all three levers of power,” Cole said, referring to the White House, Senate and House. The day before Comey’s scheduled testimony, top U.S. intelligence officials are set to appear before the same panel to discuss renewal of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which allows the government to collect communications of foreigners thought to be living overseas whose communications pass through American phone or internet providers. But senators are likely to also wade into the Russia affair. [nL1N1IZ0VV] Lawmakers must also come up with a plan to raise the country’s debt limit. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is clamoring for Congress to quickly approve more borrowing authority as the incoming stream of tax revenues slows. Republican fiscal conservatives routinely demand budget cuts and other concessions as a price for raising the debt limit, setting up a likely fight. [nL1N1IZ13F] Amid all this, Trump and his fellow Republicans in Congress hope the new work session, following a week-long Memorial Day break, will be a chance to ‘reset’ the conversation in Washington that has centered on Russia and their failures so far on healthcare and tax legislation. House Republicans hope this week to pass a repeal of portions of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. But that bill will face resistance in the Senate, where Democrats are expected to use procedural tactics to kill it. Even so, House Republicans hope passage of ‘low-hanging fruit’ bills like this will allow them to argue that they have racked up accomplishments when they go home to their districts in August. Meanwhile, the Senate is struggling to craft legislation repealing and replacing Obamacare, former President Barack Obama’s landmark law that expanded health insurance coverage to millions and placed new controls on insurers. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in a May 24 interview with Reuters said, “I don’t know how we get to 50 (votes) at the moment” but pledged to forge ahead. Senators this week are expected to be presented with  options for a new healthcare program they hope will be more acceptable to voters than one passed by the House. [nBER4WKzcM] Failure to agree on a formula by early July could doom the push to kill Obamacare, which has been a Republican vow since it became law in 2010. Congress is already months behind in writing a budget blueprint that would guide federal spending in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Republicans are deeply divided over the level of defense spending and potential structural reforms to social welfare programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. If that is not enough, House Republicans are promising to streamline the antiquated tax code and reduce rates. Democrats and some experts outside of Congress argue their approach would largely help the wealthy while ballooning the nation’s debt. ",politicsNews,"June 5, 2017 ",0

Escape from North Korea: video shows defector under fire,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean border guard briefly crossed the border with the South in the chase for a defector last week - a violation of the ceasefire accord between North and South, a video released on Wednesday by the U.N. Command (UNC) in Seoul showed. The North Koreans were only steps behind the young man when they shot him at least four times as he made his escape on Nov. 13. The video, filmed as the defector drove an army truck through the demilitarized zone and then abandoned the vehicle, gives a dramatic insight into his escape.   The defector, identified by a surgeon as a 24-year-old with the family name Oh, was flown by a U.S. military helicopter to a hospital in Suwon, south of Seoul. Doctors said he had regained consciousness, having had two operations to extract the bullets, and his breathing was stable and unassisted.   He is fine,  lead surgeon Lee Cook-Jong said at a news conference in Suwon.  He is not going to die.  A UNC official said North Korea had been informed on Wednesday that it had violated the 1953 armistice agreement, which marked the cessation of hostilities in the Korean War. The UNC official told a news conference that a soldier from the North Korean People s Army (KPA) had crossed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), the border between the two Koreas, for a few seconds as others fired shots at the defecting soldier.  The key findings of the special investigation team are that the KPA violated the armistice agreement by one, firing weapons across the MDL, and two, by actually crossing the MDL temporarily,  Chad Carroll, Director of Public Affairs for the UNC, told reporters.  The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between North Korea and the international community over its nuclear weapons program, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the defection. The video, released by the UNC, was produced from surveillance cameras on the southern side of the the Joint Security Area (JSA) inside the demilitarized zone. When tree cover is too dense to see the wounded defector crawling across the border, it switches to infra-red. The film begins with a lone dark green army jeep speeding along empty, tree-lined roads toward the border. At one checkpoint, a North Korean guard marches impassively toward the approaching vehicle. It races by. He runs in pursuit. After passing a memorial to North Korea founder Kim Il Sung, where tourists often gather, the jeep runs into a ditch just meters from the border, which is not clearly marked. For several minutes the driver tries to free the vehicle, but the wheels spin uselessly in fallen leaves. The driver abandons the vehicle and sprints away, pushing tree branches out of his way and sending leaves flying. He scrambles up a slope to cross just seconds before more guards appear, shooting as they run.  One slides into a pile of dead leaves to open fire before running forward and appearing to briefly cross the dividing line between the two countries. He quickly turns on his heel. The video does not show the moment the defector is hit, but he is seen lying in a pile of brush next to a concrete wall in a later edited clip.  The UNC s Carroll said the position was still exposed to North Korean checkpoints across the border. Allied troops operating the cameras had by then notified their commanders and a quick reaction force had assembled on the South Korean side, according to Carroll. The video does not show this force. Infrared imagery shows two South Korean soldiers crawling through undergrowth to drag the wounded North Korean to safety, while the deputy commander of the border security unit oversees the rescue from a few meters away. Doctors have conducted a series of surgeries to remove four bullets from the critically wounded soldier, who arrived at the hospital having lost a large amount of blood.  From a medical point of view he was almost dead when he was first brought here,  said the surgeon, Lee. Hospital officials said the man remains in intensive care. The soldier showed signs of depression and possible trauma, in addition to a serious case of parasites that has complicated his treatment, the hospital said in a statement. Lee said last week one of the flesh-colored parasites he removed from the soldier s digestive tract was 27 cm (10.6 in) long. Continuing stress made the soldier hesitant to talk, but he had been cooperative, doctors said. The patient first recovered consciousness on Sunday, and asked where he was in South Korea, Lee said. He was in  agony  when he came to, the surgeon added. Since then doctors have played South Korean pop music for him, and American action movies including  The Transporter   from 2002. On average more than 1,000 North Koreans defect to the South every year, but most travel via China and numbers have fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power in 2011. It is unusual for a North Korean to cross the land border dividing the two Koreas. They  have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

It also called on Pyongyang to halt child labor in farming, mining and construction, as well as discrimination against youth for the  crimes  of their parents. The U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child, which reviewed Pyongyang s record last month, voiced deep concern at what it called the  ideological indoctrination  in its education system and malnutrition among North Korean children.  We do have reports which are credible that children are at least to a certain extent tortured or exposed to violent treatment by the authorities in various circumstances,  panel member Kirsten Sandberg told a news briefing.   This might be when they return to the country after having tried to stay abroad and then are being forcibly returned. It happens on the border, we ve heard reports about violent treatment,  she said. This involved mainly North Korean children returning from China, Sandberg said, adding:  We also have reports of pregnant mothers coming back or being forcibly returned who are not to allowed to keep their babies.   We also have reports of violence against children in detention,  she said. Tensions in the region and beyond, especially with the United States, have risen considerably in recent months as North Korea conducted a series of tests of its medium- and long-range ballistic missiles, some of which flew over Japan, as well as its sixth nuclear test on Sept. 3.  The U.N. panel, in a session on Sept. 21, asked the North Korean delegation how  songbun , a system ranking citizens based on family loyalty to the ruling dynasty, affected children s access to education, health and food. The North Korean delegation replied that this was an  imaginary concept  invented by hostile forces. In its findings, the U.N. panel said it had  reports of discrimination against students based on their social status and political views of their parents .  North Korea has a  serious nutrition problem , Sandberg said.  There is still an over 40 percent rate of under-nourishment. This also a serious underlying cause for child mortality, also mortality of their mothers.  And children under five years continue to suffer from high rates of stunting and wasting,  she said. Children are told to  volunteer extensive periods of their day to work on farms and mines, collect wood in the forests, repair railroads, clean statues and participate in forestation initiatives and construction projects,  the U.N. panel said, noting these were referred to as  economic assignments . The watchdog, composed of 18 independent experts, also called on North Korea to allow children freedom of expression, including access to the Internet. North Korea told the U.N. panel last month that international sanctions imposed on it over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs would endanger the survival of North Korean children. There was no immediate reaction from Pyongyang to the findings, but a North Korean diplomat in Geneva told Reuters just before they were released:  We are committed to dialogue .

 Republicans Just Made A Decision That Probably Means They’ve Given Up On The Election,"Faced with the prospect of campaigning with Donald Trump at the top of the Republican presidential ticket, the Republican National Committee appears ready to do something unprecedented eight months before the first ballot is cast and give up on the election.The Republican National Committee is scaling back its financial commitments to some of the most hotly contested states because of flagging fund-raising, the most concrete evidence yet of how the party s divisive and protracted presidential race is threatening the party s entire ticket in November.Sean Spicer, the RNC s head strategist, admitted to the New York Times that the party was not yet ready to have field organizers in place in key swing states like Florida and Ohio because the money isn t there yet, thanks to the contentious presidential contest.Even stranger, the Republicans are setting up a fund so that the party s wealthiest supporters can direct funds towards Senate and House races, instead of the marquee presidential matchup.Just as revealing, the party is also taking steps to create a separate fund-raising entity dedicated to Senate races, an acknowledgment that many of the wealthiest contributors are increasingly focused on protecting Republican control of Congress rather than on a presidential campaign they fear is lost.It is becoming apparent that those candidates are in trouble, thanks to Trump s series of toxic comments about Latinos, Muslims, blacks, and women. Already high profile Republicans like Senator John McCain have announced that they would not be attending the convention, usually the political destination of record for both parties in election years. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush and the previous Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, both also said they would be skipping the convention as well.Polling shows that Donald Trump is the most disliked person to ever head the ticket of a major party, and in head to head polling he loses by double digits to Hillary Clinton. Trump performs so poorly that traditionally hardcore Republican states like Mississippi and Utah are within striking distance for Clinton. And in states that are part of President Obama s winning coalitions in 2012 and 2008, Trump is way behind.The Republican Establishment has already announced it plans to challenge Trump s bid to be the nominee, but it may already be too late. The election may already be lost.Featured image via Flickr",News,"April 21, 2016",1
 BUSTED: Trump Supporter Used Poll Watcher Credentials To Force Early Voters To Leave Polling Place,"Clearly, there is no low Trump supporters won t stoop in the effort to get him elected president.Ever since the Republican nominee told his deplorable supporters that the election is  rigged  and that they should become poll watchers there has been multiple incidents of voter intimidation, voter suppression, and voter fraud by Trump supporters and even an act of violence against a polling place.And another Trump supporter just got caught trying to intimidate early voters into leaving an Arkansas polling place.Thus far, early voting has benefited Hillary Clinton and that s a big deal with only four days left until Election Day. So Jefferson County Election Commission Stu Soffer, who is a Trump supporter, used his poll watcher credentials and stood in a doorway to yell at early voters at the Pine Bluff polling location to leave. Shut up and go home,  Soffer yelled while blocking the entrance to the voting booths according to Jefferson County Clerk Patricia Johnson and a voter named Victor who did not get to cast his ballot because of Soffer s interference. As a result of the disruption and confusion caused by Stu Soffer and other Republicans   I was not able to cast my ballot that day,  Victor said.According to attorney Chris Burke, who represents Victor in the lawsuit filed against Soffer,  Mr. Soffer stood in the doorway of the early-voting location and told voters to shut up and go home. As a result, Victor and many other voters were unable to cast their votes that day. This is deeply troubling to the voters of Jefferson County and also to the election administrators whose job it is to administer the elections free of fear and intimidation,  Burke added.This is just the latest incident of a Trump supporter trying to rig the election for Donald Trump.In Green Bay, Wisconsin a city clerk tried to deny a request for an extra polling place near the local university solely on the grounds that she believes college students are more likely to vote for Democrats.In Iowa, a Trump supporter literally got caught trying to vote twice and was arrested.And a right-wing group is creating fake badges so they can infiltrate polling places in order to intimidate voters on Election Day for Trump.These incidents, including this recent one in Arkansas prove that Trump supporters are trying to rig the election for their candidate and it s only going to get worse in the days ahead, especially on Election Day as conservatives desperately try to secure a victory for the Republican nominee by hook or by crook.Featured Image: Facebook",News,"November 4, 2016",1

 Case Regarding Cruz’s Birthright Citizenship Reaches Supreme Court,"One of the biggest mysteries in Constitutional Law is what the Framers meant when they said  natural born citizen.  Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution states the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States, and under clause 5 one would find the  natural born  requirement:No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.The Supreme Court will have the option to take up the case, if it so chooses, now that the lawsuit challenging Ted Cruz s eligibility to be President has been filed.Retired Utah lawyer Walter Wagner has led the  birther  movement against Ted Cruz, filing multiple lawsuits in federal court to block the Texas Republican from seeking the nomination. Wagner lost his case in Utah District Court, with Judge Jill Parrish writing:Nowhere does Mr. Wagner allege how he will be injured in a personal and individual way.All cases must show that the individual bringing the lawsuit has suffered, is suffering, or will suffer an injury personal to them, and that their rights have been violated. Wagner contends that he does have a vested interest, saying it s his job at  insuring that all candidates for the position of president are legally qualified.  Basically, he s a taxpayer and an American citizen, so he has a particular interest in who the president is.After being smacked down in Utah, Wagner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver and subsequently the U.S.  Supreme Court.Hopefully the Justices see fit to end this ridiculous talking point, seeing as though Trump will most likely emerge as the nominee. Also, establishing sound Constitutional decision to this long mysterious issue. Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty",News,"April 9, 2016",1
U.S. 'not taking sides' in Iraqi-Kurdish dispute: Trump,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States sought on Monday to avoid openly taking sides in an Iraqi-Kurdish dispute, as Iraq s capture of the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk raised the risk of an open conflict between U.S. allies in the fight against Islamic State. U.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment the two sides were fighting.  We don t like the fact that they re clashing. We re not taking sides,  Trump told reporters at the White House.   We ve had for many years a very good relationship with the Kurds as you know and we ve also been on the side of Iraq, even though we should have never been there in the first place. We should never have been there. But we re not taking sides in that battle.  Iraqi government forces captured the major Kurdish-held oil city of Kirkuk on Monday, responding to a Kurdish referendum on independence with a bold lightning strike that transforms the balance of power in the country. A convoy of armored vehicles from Iraq s elite U.S.-trained Counter-Terrorism Force seized Kirkuk s provincial government headquarters on Monday afternoon, less than a day after the operation began, a Reuters reporter in Kirkuk said. Senator John McCain, the influential chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, warned Iraq s government of  severe consequences  over any further misuse of U.S.-provided weaponry against Kurdish forces. Pentagon spokesman Colonel Robert Manning declined to speculate on whether the United States might cut off military aid and training to Iraqi forces in the event a major conflict, saying:  I m not going to speculate on that but I will tell you that we re looking at all options for planning considerations ... We encourage dialogue.  ",worldnews,"October 16, 2017 ",0
"U.N. rebukes Philippines president Duterte, Burundi officials for threats","GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations human rights office on Tuesday condemned attacks and threats made against its investigators by Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and by senior Burundian officials.  Last week Mr Duterte threatened to slap (U.N. special rapporteur Agnes) Callamard if she investigates him for alleged extrajudicial killings,  U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville told a news briefing.  He made the same threat against her in June after she criticized his  war on drugs  campaign which has left thousands dead,  he added, referring to remarks made after her visit in May in an unofficial capacity to attend an academic conference. The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday began hearing arguments in a petition to declare Duterte s deadly war on drugs, denounced by rights groups across the world, as unconstitutional. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed drugs suspects resisted arrest in the 16 month-long campaign. Critics say executions are taking place with zero accountability, allegations the police reject. Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, is an independent expert reporting to the U.N. Human Rights Council. Her planned visit to the Philippines last December was called off because she refused to accept Duterte s conditions. Recently she has also been subjected to a  tirade of online abuse, including physical threats, during what appears to be a prolonged and well-orchestrated trolling operation across the internet and on social media , Colville said.   We condemn this treatment of Ms Callamard and the disrespect it shows to the Human Rights Council that appointed her in the strongest terms,  he added.  On Burundi, the U.N. rights office has written to the Bujumbura government to demand that officials stop  threatening with prosecution  members of a U.N. Commission of Inquiry that found Burundian officials at the highest level should be held accountable for crimes against humanity, Colville said. Burundi s ambassador in New York told the U.N. General Assembly that the inquiry s report was biased and politically motivated and threatened to  bring to justice  its authors for defamation and attempted detribalization, he said. Burundi is an elected member of the 47-member Human Rights Council, the main U.N. rights forum.  All states should cooperate with mandates established by the Council. None of them are established without good cause,  Colville said. ",worldnews,"November 21, 2017 ",0
HOW GORSUCH Will Have Immediate Effect On Historic 2nd Amendment Decision And These Significant Controversial Cases,"Neil M. Gorsuch joins the Supreme Court just in time to cast potentially significant votes in cases that pit religious liberty against gay rights, test limits on funding for church schools and challenge California s restrictions on carrying a concealed gun in public.Such issues arise either in appeals filed by conservative groups that have been pending before the justices for weeks or in cases to be heard later this month.Gorsuch s votes in those matters may give an early sign of whether the court s conservatives   with their 5-4 majority restored by his confirmation   will pursue an activist agenda.The cases include a Colorado baker s claim that he deserves a faith-based exemption from the state s anti-discrimination law after he refused to design a wedding cake for a gay couple. The justices have been considering his appeal behind closed doors since December, but have taken no action.  LA TimesA Second Amendment controversy arising from California, would be the biggest gun-rights decision in several years, should the justices agree to hear it.In D.C. v. Heller and McDonald v. Chicago, the Court ruled that the Constitution protects the right to keep functional firearms in the home for self-defense, and that state and local governments cannot infringe upon said right. The challenge now pending before the Court, Peruta v. California, involves the right to carry a firearm outside the home for self-defense.The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling in 2016 affording county governments in California significant leeway in the issuance of concealed carry permits. Some permit regimes in the state are fairly accommodating of applicants, while others make it functionally impossible to obtain a concealed carry license. A group of Second Amendment applicants challenged the 9th Circuit s decision.Should the justices take the case and side with the activists, they could announce a constitutionally-protected right to bear firearms outside the home for the first time in American history.Via: Daily Caller",left-news,"Apr 9, 2017",1
"MI BOARD OF EDUCATION Will Allow Students To Choose Gender, Bathroom, Locker Room And Even A New Name With No Parental Consent","Every parent in the United States of America should be alarmed by this covert attempt by Board of Education members to essentially tell our kids that their power supersedes that of the parents. Furthermore, this reckless policy of placing same sex kids in bathrooms and locker rooms puts children in danger of being in private spaces with sexual predators and or sexual offenders Make sure to add your comments to the MI Board of Educations HEREMichigan s State Board of Education has drafted a guidance that would push the state s schools to allow all students, regardless of parental or doctoral input, to choose their gender, name, pronouns, and bathrooms.Spearheaded by board president John C. Austin and signed by state superintendent Brian Whiston, the guidance informs Michigan public schools that only the students themselves i.e. not their parents or doctors can determine what their individual gender identities are. The responsibility for determining a student s gender identity rests with the student. Outside confirmation from medical or mental health professionals, or documentation of legal changes, is not needed,  the guidance states.Gender identity is defined in the guidance as  a person s deeply held internal sense or psychological knowledge of their own gender, regardless of the biological sex they were assigned at birth. Notably, the guidance makes no mention of a student s age affecting whether or not they can pick a gender without their parent or doctor.In fact, the guidance seems to intentionally cut parents out of the process.The guidance states:  School staff should address students by their chosen name and pronouns that correspond to their gender identity, regardless of whether there has been a legal name change. Students can even ask to have their chosen name and gender  included in the district s information management systems, in addition to the student s legal name. But what about when school staff members are speaking with parents about their son or daughter?The guidance states that  Transgender and GNC [gender nonconforming] students have the right to decide when, with whom, and to what extent to share private information. Accordingly, the board makes clear,  When contacting the parent/guardian of a transgender or GNC student, school staff should use the student s legal name and the pronoun corresponding to the student s assigned sex at birth, unless the student or parent/guardian has specified otherwise. In other words, a boy named  Jake  could become a girl named  Jane  at school, seemingly without his parents ever knowing.Names, pronouns, and genders aren t the only things the board wants students to choose.The guidance informs schools that  Students should be allowed to use the restroom in accordance with their gender identity. And the board makes clear that single-stall bathrooms are not inclusive enough:  Alternative and non-stigmatizing options, such as an all-gender or singleuser restroom (e.g., staff bathroom or nurse s office), should be made available to students who request them, but not presented as the only option. Locker rooms also should become inclusive of students  many gender identities.  A student should not be required to use a locker room that is incongruent with their gender identity,  the guidance states.  Locker room usage should be determined on a case-by-case basis, using the guiding principles of safety and honoring the student s gender identity and expression. Students who are bothered by having members of the opposite sex in their locker rooms can request  an adjusted changing schedule  or  use of a private area in the facility. The board quietly issued the statement and guidance on February 23rd, without a press release. The public has only until April 11th to comment on the proposed guidance, according to the Department of Education website. The board will finalize the guidance at a meeting on May 10th.

"""The people have spoken,"" says Zimbabwe's new leader","HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s new leader Emmerson Mnangagwa told a cheering crowd in Harare on Wednesday that the country was entering a new stage of democracy following Robert Mugabe s removal as president after nearly four decades in power. Mnangagwa returned to the country earlier in the day, having fled for his safety when the 93-year-old former leader sacked him as vice president two weeks ago to smooth a path to the succession for his much younger wife Grace.   The people have spoken. The voice of the people is the voice of God,  Mnangagwa told thousands of supporters gathered outside the ruling ZANU-PF party s offices in the capital.  Today we are witnessing the beginning of a new and unfolding democracy.  Zimbabwe was once one of Africa s most promising economies but suffered decades of decline as Mugabe pursued policies that included the violent seizure of white-owned commercial farms and money-printing that led to hyperinflation.  Most of its 16 million people remain poor and face currency shortages and sky-high unemployment, something Mnangagwa promised to address.   We want to grow our economy, we want peace in our country, we want jobs, jobs, jobs,  he told the crowd, adding:  The will of the people will always, always succeed.   Mnangagwa s dismissal was the trigger for the army and former political allies to move against Mugabe, feted as an independence hero when Zimbabwe broke with former colonial power Britain in 1980 but later feared as a despot. He resigned as president on Tuesday as parliament began an impeachment process, after resisting pressure to do so for a week. People danced in the streets following his downfall, some brandishing posters of Mnangagwa and army chief General Constantino Chiwenga, who led the takeover. Parliamentary speaker Jacob Mudenda said on Wednesday that Mnangagwa would be sworn in as president on Friday after being nominated by ZANU-PF to fill the vacancy left by Mugabe. The demise of Mugabe leaves Zimbabwe in a different situation to a number of other African countries where veteran leaders have been toppled in popular uprisings or through elections. The army appears to have engineered a trouble-free path to power for Mnangagwa, who was for decades a faithful lieutenant of Mugabe and member of his elite. He was also in charge of internal security when rights groups say 20,000 civilians were killed in the 1980s.  Mugabe has gone but I don t see Mnangagwa doing anything different from that old man. This is not the change I expected but let us give him time,  said security guard Edgar Mapuranga, who sat by a bank cash machine that was out of money. Restoring the country s fortunes and international standing will be a challenge. Alleged human rights abuses and flawed elections prompted many Western countries to impose sanctions in the early 2000s that further hurt the economy, even with Chinese investment to soften the blow. Staging clean elections next year will be key to winning fresh funds. Although Mnangagwa is almost certain to win any vote, German Chancellor Angela Merkel s personal representative for Africa, Guenther Nooke, said it would be a victory for Zimbabwe s  old elites  with the help of China.   He will manage to get elected using fear or many tricks, and then we ll have a succession from one tyrant to the next,  Nooke told broadcaster SWR2. China s foreign ministry said on Wednesday it respected Mugabe s decision to resign. In London, Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain wanted Zimbabwe to rejoin the international community now that Mugabe has resigned. Mnangagwa met neighboring South Africa s President Jacob Zuma before his return on Wednesday. Mugabe is one of the last of a generation of African leaders who led their countries to independence and then ruled, among them Ghana s Kwame Nkrumah, Jomo Kenyatta in Kenya, Felix Houphouet-Boigny in Ivory Coast and South Africa s Nelson Mandela. The African Union said he would be remembered  as a fearless pan-Africanist liberation fighter and the father of the independent Zimbabwean nation  and that his decision to step down would enhance his legacy.     But he also stifled democracy en route to winning a series of elections. His government is accused by the opposition and human rights groups of persecuting and killing opponents. The forced takeover of white-owned farms from around 2000 aimed to bolster his popular support but crippled foreign exchange earnings from agriculture. Mnangagwa s human rights record also stirs hostility in many Zimbabweans.  The dark past is not going to disappear. They will be following him around like a piece of chewing gum on his shoe,  International Crisis Group s southern Africa senior consultant Piers Pigou said.  For him to really be seen to be doing the right thing, he s going to have to introduce policies that fundamentally undermine the power structures of ZANU-PF, through a shift to genuine political pluralism and a decoupling of the party and state.

Winning Democrat nomination needs voter coalition: Clinton campaign,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The campaign of Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton on Wednesday called support from a broad coalition of voters - including people of color, women and union households - “critical” for anyone hoping to secure the party’s nomination for the November 2016 election and beyond. Robby Mook, Clinton’s campaign manager, noted support for the former secretary of state among African Americans, Latinos and Asian American Pacific Islanders, women and union households in a memo sent out by the campaign.  He also noted that Clinton won white voters in the nominating contests for several states on Super Tuesday, the previous day, in which Clinton won seven states to the four states captured by her rival, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. “It is also important to note that these constituencies are not only critical to winning the Democratic nomination but will also be central to how a Democrat wins in November, and a candidate that starts with a deep base of support will have an advantage in the general election,” Mook wrote.

Senior U.S. Republican senator: 'Let Mr. Mueller do his job',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The special counsel investigation of links between Russia and President Trump’s 2016 election campaign should continue without interference in 2018, despite calls from some Trump administration allies and Republican lawmakers to shut it down, a prominent Republican senator said on Sunday. Lindsey Graham, who serves on the Senate armed forces and judiciary committees, said Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller needs to carry on with his Russia investigation without political interference. “This investigation will go forward. It will be an investigation conducted without political influence,” Graham said on CBS’s Face the Nation news program. “And we all need to let Mr. Mueller do his job. I think he’s the right guy at the right time.”  The question of how Russia may have interfered in the election, and how Trump’s campaign may have had links with or co-ordinated any such effort, has loomed over the White House since Trump took office in January. It shows no sign of receding as Trump prepares for his second year in power, despite intensified rhetoric from some Trump allies in recent weeks accusing Mueller’s team of bias against the Republican president. Trump himself seemed to undercut his supporters in an interview last week with the New York Times in which he said he expected Mueller was “going to be fair.”    Russia’s role in the election and the question of possible links to the Trump campaign are the focus of multiple inquiries in Washington. Three committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives are investigating, as well as Mueller, whose team in May took over an earlier probe launched by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Several members of the Trump campaign and administration have been convicted or indicted in the investigation.  Trump and his allies deny any collusion with Russia during the campaign, and the Kremlin has denied meddling in the election. Graham said he still wants an examination of the FBI’s use of a dossier on links between Trump and Russia that was compiled by a former British spy, Christopher Steele, which prompted Trump allies and some Republicans to question Mueller’s inquiry.   On Saturday, the New York Times reported that it was not that dossier that triggered an early FBI probe, but a tip from former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos to an Australian diplomat that Russia had damaging information about former Trump rival Hillary Clinton.  “I want somebody to look at the way the Department of Justice used this dossier. It bothers me greatly the way they used it, and I want somebody to look at it,” Graham said. But he said the Russia investigation must continue. “As a matter of fact, it would hurt us if we ignored it,” he said. ",politicsNews,"December 31, 2017 ",0
LISTEN TO THEM LAUGH! Undercover VIDEO Captures Diabolical Remarks At National ABORTION Federation Conference…”An Eyeball Just Fell Into My Lap..And That’s Gross”,"A shocking new video has just been released by the Center for Medical Progress, the undercover investigative group that in 2015 released videos showing that Planned Parenthood affiliates have profited from selling the body parts of aborted babies.This latest video is a preview of footage that CMP investigators gathered at the 2014 and 2015 National Abortion Federation conventions, attended by hundreds of members of the abortion industry each year. (The NAF is a major trade group of North American abortion providers, and Planned Parenthood makes up about 50 percent of its members and leadership.)Notice the audience laughing at some of the most vile comments you have ever heard about the killing and dismembering of babies in the womb:https://youtu.be/Sq1ycCmX3uUHere are some of the most horrifying remarks from the brand-new undercover footage. Attendees made some of these comments during official presentations, and others directly to undercover CMP investigators.Dr. Lisa Harris, the medical director of Planned Parenthood of Michigan: Given that we actually see the fetus the same way, and given that we might actually both agree that there s violence in here. . . . Let s just give them all the violence, it s a person, it s killing, let s just give them all that.Dr. Ann Schutt-Aine, the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast (which has been referred to local law-enforcement for criminal charges related to fetal-tissue trafficking): If I m doing a procedure, and I m seeing that I m in fear that it s about to come to the umbilicus [navel], I might ask for a second set of forceps to hold the body at the cervix and pull off a leg or two, so it s not PBA [partial-birth abortion].Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood of New York City: But we certainly do intact D&Es [dilation and extraction, otherwise known as partial-birth abortion, a method that is illegal under federal law].Dr. Uta Landy, the founder of the Consortium of Abortion Providers (CAPS), Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA): An eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross! [laughter from the crowd]Talcott Camp, the deputy director of the ACLU s Reproductive Health Freedom Project: I m like   Oh my God! I get it! When the skull is broken, that s really sharp! I get it! I understand why people are talking about getting that skull out, that calvarium. Dr. Susan Robinson, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte: The fetus is a tough little object, and taking it apart, I mean, taking it apart on Day One is very difficult. . . . You go in there, and you go,  Am I getting the uterus or the fetus? Oh, good, fetus. [Robinson makes a stabbing sound effect] What have I got? Nothing. Let s try again. Below are some comments from the footage that provide further evidence of Planned Parenthood s involvement in illegally profiting from fetal-tissue trafficking.Dr. Leslie Drummond, an abortion provider at Planned Parenthood Mar Monte (a PPFA affiliate that contracted with a biotech firm to be paid per fetal organ provided): I get a lot of oohs and ahhs from StemExpress [biotech firm]. You know, they re wanting livers. . . . Last week I was in Sacramento, and she said,  I need four intact limbs.  And I said, you want what?This part of the video should dispel any doubt Americans had about Planned Parenthood selling baby parts for profit:Dr. Stacy De-Lin, the director of abortion services for Planned Parenthood of NYC: But I think a financial incentive from you guys [CMP investigators posing as tissue buyers] is going to be like . . .  the people who we have to get this approved from will be very happy about it. Dr. Paul Blumenthal, the former medical director for PP of Maryland: I know Planned Parenthood sells a lot of stuff [fetal organs] to people. Both the NAF and Planned Parenthood sought and obtained a preliminary injunction against the Center for Medical Progress to prevent the release of these undercover videos. That civil suit is currently on appeal. But California s attorney general took matters into his own hands in late March, charging CMP investigators David Daleiden and Sandra Merritt with 14 felony counts of illegally recording  confidential communications.  The state refuses to name the 14 accusers in the criminal case, even though Daleiden and Merritt have themselves been charged publicly.Read more at: National Review",politics,"May 25, 2017",1
Indonesia detains 18 in pre-emptive bid to boost Christmas security,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian anti-terrorism police have detained 18 people with links to militant groups in a bid to cut the risk of attacks during Christmas and the New Year in the world s biggest Muslim-majority country, police said on Monday. Near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital, Jakarta, and elsewhere on Christmas Eve in 2000, killed nearly 20 people. Ever since, authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday. Police Chief Tito Karnavian said while there was no evidence of a specific plot, the detentions were made in a bid to head off trouble.  We re doing a pre-emptive strike,  Karnavian told reporters.       The majority of them have links to previous incidents (and people) who we had arrested earlier,  he said. Police said that 12 people had been detained in South Sumatra, four in West Kalimantan, one in Malang in East Java and one in Surabaya in the same province. Under Indonesia s anti-terrorism laws, investigators can hold people for seven days before determining whether they will be designated suspects or released, said police spokesman Setyo Wasisto. Indonesia has seen its share of militant attacks over the years aimed at foreign, Christian and government targets including blasts on the tourist island of Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people. Since then, police have managed to stamp out or weaken many militant networks although there has been a resurgence in radicalism in recent years, inspired largely by Islamic State. A series of small-scale attacks since early 2016 has been linked to Islamic State, which is believed to have thousands of sympathizers in Indonesia.    ",worldnews,"December 11, 2017 ",0
Senator Markey wants government informed of aviation cyber attacks,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator on Thursday introduced legislation calling for airlines and aircraft manufacturers to disclose cyber security incidents to federal authorities, saying the aviation system lacks sufficient standards and oversight.  The measure, introduced by Democratic Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts, would also require the Federal Aviation Administration and other federal agencies to identify cyber  vulnerabilities within the aviation system and establish standards for addressing them. The measure also calls for a study on potential vulnerabilities posed the use of consumer wireless devices aboard flights.    Cyber security has emerged as a major issue for commercial airliners and other aircraft as the U.S. aviation system evolves to technology based on wireless and internet connectivity. The industry has stepped up efforts to forge a coordinated response. But companies are not required to report attempted or successful attacks in the United States.  While introducing the measure, Markey said his own informal survey of airlines and aircraft manufacturers showed that no successful cyber attack against aircraft has been confirmed. But he said hacking attempts are common and efforts to thwart them can be inconsistent and poorly overseen.      The senator presented his legislation as an amendment to an FAA bill that the Senate is expected to vote on later this month. The measure was quickly endorsed by the Association of Flight Attendants labor union. But it was not clear whether lawmakers would accept the measure as part of the FAA bill.

 Historian BURIES Every Excuse Senate Republicans Have Used To Block Obama’s SCOTUS Nominee,"Senate Republicans were just taken to the woodshed by a historian for their unprecedented obstruction of President Obama s Supreme Court nominee.Ever since Justice Antonin Scalia died in February, Republicans have used every excuse they can think of to justify their refusal to even consider anyone President Obama picks to fill the vacancy.And in response to an op-ed written by GOP Senator Orrin Hatch in which he lists several of those excuses, a historian fired back with an op-ed of his own completely burying each and every one of them.When Hatch suggested the rules are different when replacing one of  the greatest jurists in our nation s history,  Wofford College Professor Mark S. Byrnes replied,  it does not matter who the president is replacing. All openings on the Court are created equal. And frankly, Scalia was one of the worst Supreme Court Justices this country has ever had the misfortune to witness. He was easily swayed in his decisions by gifts from those who wanted him to rule a certain way and many of his dissents are nothing more than glorified temper tantrums that had little to do with constitutional interpretation and more to do with failing to force another aspect of the right-wing agenda down our throats.Byrnes then scorched Hatch for accusing President Obama of disagreeing with Scalia s philosophy and reminded him that,  When the electorate once again decisively elected Obama as president in 2012, it did not include an asterisk that said he could only replace justices with whom he agreed. Indeed, if that were the case we wouldn t have Clarence Thomas on the bench because former President George H. W. Bush would have had to nominate someone with a liberal philosophy similar to Justice Thurgood Marshall, whom Thomas replaced, to the high court.Hatch also complained about President Obama opposing two nominees of former President George W. Bush as a senator and claimed Obama has repeatedly exceeded constitutional authority. Byrnes slapped those two excuses down by noting that at least Bush s nominees received a vote and that if Republicans really believed Obama has done something wrong they would have drawn up articles of impeachment by now.Hatch also pointed out that Americans chose a Democratic president and a Republican Senate, but that was easily countered as well as Byrnes noted that Obama nominated centrist Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.  He did not chose someone who was a darling of the Democratic left, but someone who has (in the past) been repeatedly praised by Republicans, including Hatch himself,  Byrnes noted.Byrnes then lambasted Hatch for getting American history wrong.Hatch claimed in his op-ed that,  Throughout its history, the Senate has never confirmed a nominee to fill a Supreme Court vacancy that occurred this late in a term-limited president s time in office. And Bynes really handed Hatch his ass on this claim.As a history teacher, I am used to the instinct unprepared undergraduates have to bolster a poor argument with the  throughout history  trick. I expect better of United States Senators.Hatch shows his contempt for his readers with this tortured construction. To make his  throughout its history  line work, Hatch needs to make that history awfully short. He does that with the phrase  term-limited.  The 22nd Amendment, which imposes term limits on presidents, has only been in effect for 65 years. So this particular  throughout its history  means for 65 years less than Hatch s own life span.Bynres goes on to note that  there has only been one other vacancy during that period that was  this late  in a president s term: LBJ s nomination of Abe Fortas in 1968. Yes, Fortas was not confirmed as Chief Justice. That nomination received a hearing, however, and a vote. It was not met with this disingenuous nonsense that  we never do this.  And as Hatch well knows, 1968 was one of the most contentious elections years in American history. Somehow, the Senate still did its job.Byrnes also blasted Hatch for using how nasty the current election has been as an excuse to not do his job because only Republicans have made the election nasty thus far. And when Hatch claimed that both parties have politicized the confirmation process, Byrnes observed that only Republicans are escalating the politicization to an unprecedented height this time around.In his conclusion, Byrnes urged Republicans to stop acting like  cowards  and stop pretending that their obstruction is about something more than just trying to keep the Supreme Court conservative.If Hatch and his fellow Republicans want to vote against Judge Garland, they have every right to do so. But they should stop being cowards. They should make a substantive argument against him. vote against him, and accept the political consequences of that vote. They should stop pretending that this reckless path they have chosen is anything but a desperate attempt to hold onto a Supreme Court majority.Seriously, Senate Republicans need to stop with the excuses and do their job. They have thrown their little temper tantrum and they have lost the argument repeatedly. Every excuse they have offered has literally been destroyed by facts and historical evidence. They need to get over it and get the Court back to full capacity or the American people will have another real excuse to boot them out of office in November.Featured image: Cagle",News,"March 31, 2016",1
Myanmar military appoints general to probe mass grave in Rakhine state,"YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s army said on Wednesday that it had appointed a senior officer to investigate whether any members of the security forces were involved in the killing of 10 people whose bodies have been uncovered in a mass grave in Rakhine State. A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the western state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months. The discover of the grave, at the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of the state capital Sittwe, was announced by the military two days ago. In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said a five-member investigation team had left the capital Naypyitaw on Wednesday. The team, led by Lieutenant General Aye Win, would  investigate whether the security forces took part or not, in relation to the unidentified dead bodies found in Inn Din village graveyard . It gave no further details and military officials were not immediately available for comment. General Aye Win is the same officer who led a wider probe into the conduct of troops in a conflict that began in late August, which concluded in a report last month that no atrocities took place. Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25. Rights monitors have accused troops of abuses, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya. The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence. ",worldnews,"December 20, 2017 ",0
" Greedy Oil CEO Fires 20 Percent Of Employees, Awards Himself $18 Million","The World s largest oil field service, Schlumberger, has been bleeding profits since an oversupply of oil drove the cost per barrel from $100 in 2014 to $33.01. CEO Paal Kibsgaard saw his company profits decrease 40 percent since the downward trend in oil prices began, and as a result he fired 25,000 people in 2015, roughly 20 percent of the company s workforce.The CEO felt the pain in his company s loss of profits though as his salary decreased from $18.5 million in 2014 to $18.3 million in 2015. The drop was only due to the performance in his pension plan though, as his base salary  and stock values increased from 2014.Despite running a failing company, Kibsgaard remains one of the highest paid CEOs in the World. In 2014, CNN Money ranked him as number 9 on their list of the 12 highest paid CEOs in the World.Forbes listed Schlumberger as #123 on its list of largest public companies, with a market cap of $109.8 billion as of May 2015. The sheer size, scope and profits the company makes should inoculate it to some degree from making enormous employee layoffs, leaving thousands of men and women with families unemployed, facing inadequate compensation and the stressors inherent with re-entering the job market. Layoffs are often a sign of failure by top executives to properly manage a business and forecast needs,  wrote Eleanor Boxham in a 2013 Fortune magazine article.  And failure of board members to ensure that the right management is in place. Given this sign of failure from Schlumberger s CEO, it is ethically abhorrent he receives such a high salary the same year the company lays off thousands of lower level employees. Despite the layoffs, the company s stock has steadily increased lately, and unfortunately that is all these corporate leaders, especially in the oil industry, care about. These attitudes are what contribute to the growing income and wealthy inequality not just in America, but all over the World. The 62 wealthiest people in the world have as much wealth as the bottom 50 percent of the world, nearly 3.6 billion people. The wealthiest 1 percent of the World s population have as much wealth as the other 99 percent. For nearly fifty years, wages of working people in the United States have remained stagnant while the top income earners have seen their salaries grow exponentially. In the United States since the 2008 recession, nearly 99 percent of all new generated income has gone to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans. Current trends suggest these enormous disparities in wealth are expanding, and if CEOs like Kibsgaard are allowed to take home huge salaries while simultaneously firing thousands of people, things are only going to get worse.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr",News,"February 26, 2016",1

CHECK OUT THE NAME! FOOD STAMP FRAUD OF OVER $5.7 MILLION From ONE Store!,"WATERBURY   A federal agent, with help from an informant, went undercover for nearly two years to document food stamp fraud occurring at an inner-city market whose employees were busted in recent weeks.Though W.B. Trade Fair Supermarket, a small corner market on Willow Street, had dusty cans and only one regularly used register, federal authorities estimated they have redeemed almost $5.7 million in food stamps since 2011.But those benefits weren t used to provide nutritional food to city residents, rather they were swapped for cash, glass smoking pipes and even power tools, federal authorities allege.A recently unsealed federal search warrant for the store shows an undercover agent with the Office of the Inspector General suspected the store of  trafficking,  or exchanging large amounts of benefits for cash.Tallat Mahmood, 63, Raul Carlos Monarca, 40, and Tahir Shahzad, 32, of Harrison, N.Y. were charged with federal food stamp fraud and illegally trafficking in food stamp benefits.The food stamp program is aimed at giving low-income residents the ability to purchase nutritious foods using a type of debit card called an EBT. But people enrolled in the program are barred from buying booze, cigarettes, paper goods and soap, among other items. The market is well stocked with everything from rice and sugar, to doorknobs and scented candles.But authorities say the trio allowed customers to illegally swap their federal food stamps, known as Supplemental Nutrition and Assistance Program or SNAP benefits, for cigarettes, bongs, hookahs and glass smoking pipes, which are in display cases at the front of the store.When the EBT card is run through a special terminal, the total amount of items is inputted by the store, which is then deducted from the person s SNAP account. When that occurs, that inputted amount is then transferred to the store s bank account.Federal authorities allege the men exploited those transfers, giving customers a meager portion of their SNAP benefits in cash, while the rest went into the store s bank account. Store employees are supposed to ensure the items being purchased are eligible for the benefits when they run the person s EBT card.THE STORE OPENED IN early 2011 and by March of that year the owners applied to accept SNAP benefits, federal authorities allege. The store redeemed $6,532 in SNAP benefits in April 2011, but by March of this year, that one-month tally had grown to more than $179,000, according to federal documents.The agent, along with an informant, visited the store 19 times starting in 2014 and paid about $7,381 in SNAP benefits in exchange for about $2,905 in cash  and a number of eligible and ineligible items such as soda, chips, glass pipes, bongs, hookahs, and hardware. For instance, in April, the agent was given $200 cash, two glass smoking pipes, an electric circular saw and cigarettes in exchange for $583 in SNAP benefits.Only weeks later, a federal SNAP employee visited the store under the guise of inspecting it to talk about SNAP rules and regulations.Shahzad indicated he knew that exchanging cash for SNAP benefits was prohibited, while Mahmood stated the benefits were to  buy food, that s it  and  no lottery. Only weeks later during another visit by the undercover agent, an employee at the store gave him $200 cash for $540 in benefits.THOUGH AUTHORITIES SUSPECT the store redeemed more than $5 million in federal benefits, the store employees were charged with fraud based on a roughly 18-month span starting in 2014 where the store took in $3.2 million in benefits. This practice results in illegal profits to traffickers, misuse of government funds intended to provide food for needy families, and the creation of a market for stolen or fraudulently obtained SNAP benefits,  the agent wrote of alleged traffickers, according to a federal search warrant for the store.The store now only accepts cash for payment, according to a sign on its door.Mahmood and Shahzad are free after they posted bond, but they were ordered to surrender their passports. Monarca has not been released from jail. If convicted, they face a maximum of five years in prison.The principal member of the store is listed as Aijaz Ahmed, according to state business records, but he has not been charged with any crime.Via: REP-AM",Government News,"Sep 6, 2016",1
Tennessee lawmaker ousted after sex harassment allegations: media,"NASHVILLE (Reuters) - A Tennessee lawmaker was expelled from the state’s House of Representatives on Tuesday following accusations of widespread sexual harassment, media reported.  Republican state Representative Jeremy Durham was ousted by a vote of 70-2, according to the Tennessean newspaper, which said this was the state’s first legislative expulsion since 1980.  Durham did not immediately respond to request for comment. The Tennessean reported that Durham said no formal complaint had been filed against him and that he has not been charged with a crime.  “I’m very pleased that the House made the decision it did today. This was good for the taxpayers of the state. It was good for the victims of the state,” the newspaper quoted House Speaker Beth Harwell as saying.   A spokeswoman for Harwell’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  A report released by Tennessee’s attorney general in July accused Durham of inappropriate sexual conduct with 22 women over a four-year period. The report said Durham repeatedly made unwelcome sexual advances toward female legislative staff, interns and lobbyists. Durham declined to be interviewed by investigators, the report said. His lawyer, Bill Harbison, said at the time that the report was politically motivated and unfair. Harbison could not be immediately reached for comment on Tuesday.  The chairman of Tennessee’s Republican Party, Ryan Haynes, said on Tuesday: “I am saddened that all of my former colleagues, both Republicans and Democrats, have been placed in this terrible position by the reprehensible misbehavior of one individual.”   ",politicsNews,"September 13, 2016 ",0
Trump: China's North Korea diplomacy appears to have 'no impact on Little Rocket Man',"WASHINGTON/MOSCOW (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump dismissed a Chinese diplomatic effort to rein in North Korea s weapons program as a failure on Thursday, while Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Beijing was doing a lot, but could do more to limit oil supplies to Pyongyang. In a tweet, Trump delivered another insulting barb against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who he called  Little Rocket Man  and a  sick puppy  after North Korea test-fired its most advanced missile to date on Wednesday.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Washington s approach was dangerously provocative.  Trump s tweets further inflamed tensions reignited this week after North Korea said it had successfully tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile in a  breakthrough  that put the U.S. mainland within range of its nuclear weapons whose warheads could withstand re-entry to the Earth s atmosphere.  The Chinese envoy, who just returned from North Korea, seems to have had no impact on Little Rocket Man,  Trump said on Twitter, a day after speaking with Chinese President Chinese President Xi Jinping and reiterating his call for Beijing to use its leverage against North Korea. Tillerson on Thursday welcomed Chinese efforts on North Korea, but said Beijing could do more to limit its oil exports to the country.  The Chinese are doing a lot. We do think they could do more with the oil. We re really asking them to please restrain more of the oil, not cut it off completely,  Tillerson said at the State Department. China is North Korea s neighbor and its sole major trading partner. While Trump has been bellicose at times in rhetoric toward North Korea, Tillerson has persistently held out hopes for a return to dialogue if North Korea shows it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons program.  However, Tillerson may not remain in his job long, with disagreements with Trump over North Korea being one factor. On Thursday, senior Trump administration officials said the White House was considering a plan to replace Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he still had confidence in diplomatic efforts on North Korea and that the United States would be  unrelenting  in working through the United Nations. In spite of Trump s rhetoric and warnings that all options, including military ones, are on the table in dealing with North Korea, his administration has stressed it favors a diplomatic solution to the crisis.  Trump has pledged more sanctions in response to the latest  test and, at an emergency U.N. Security Council meeting late Wednesday, the United States warned North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out.  This administration is focused on one big thing when it comes to North Korea, and that s denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,  White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a regular White House briefing.  Anything beyond that is not the priority at this point,  she said, responding to a question on whether regime change was on the administration s agenda after Trump s recent tweets and a speech by U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley. Lavrov pointed to joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises planned for December and accused the United States of trying to provoke Kim into  flying off the handle  over his missile program to hand Washington a pretext to destroy his country.   He also flatly rejected a U.S. call for Russia to cut ties with Pyongyang over its nuclear and ballistic missile program, calling U.S. policy toward North Korea deeply flawed. In a call with Trump on Thursday, South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the missile launched this week was North Korea s most advanced so far, but it was unclear whether Pyongyang had the technology to miniaturize a nuclear warhead and it still needed to prove other things, such as its re-entry technology. A White House statement said Trump and Moon reiterated their strong commitment to enhancing the deterrence and defense capabilities of the U.S.-South Korea alliance and added:  Both leaders reaffirmed their strong commitment to compelling North Korea to return to the path of denuclearization at any cost.  North Korea has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under Kim s leadership and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in September. It has said its weapons programs are a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War, denies any such intention. Previous U.S. administrations have failed to stop North Korea from developing nuclear weapons and a sophisticated missile program. Trump, who has previously said the United States would  totally destroy  North Korea if necessary to protect itself and its allies from the nuclear threat, has also struggled to contain Pyongyang since taking office in January.

North Korea: Will World War III Kick Off This Week?,"by Neil Clark for RTOf course, in State Department-friendly Western media, it s North Korea and its leadership who are routinely portrayed as the nut jobs. But you don t have to carry a torch for the North Korean government or be a card-carrying member of the Kim Jong-un Appreciation Society to acknowledge that the country s leadership has actually been behaving very rationally. Because recent history tells us that the best way to deter an attack from the US and its allies is not to disarm, dress up as John Lennon and make statements about how much you desire peace, but to do the exact opposite.The crisis on the Korean Peninsula is due to the actions of a rogue state ruled by madmen with nukes. This rogue state is of course the USA. https://t.co/A0JynTPlSy  John Wight (@JohnWight1) August 11, 2017Consider what happened to Yugoslavia, Iraq and Libya. Like the DPRK, all three were US  target states . And all three were destroyed and their leaders killed. Do we honestly think these countries would have been attacked had they possessed nukes or missiles that could reach US targets? Of course not.  Detailed analysis of these conflicts shows us that the Empire gets its way through a mixture of bluff followed by the use of military force, but only when it believes the risks are minimal, or non-existent. If it believes the risks are too high, it backs off and starts talking about the need for  dialogue  and  diplomacy .To understand how the global hegemon acts in the international arena we don t need to study huge academic textbooks, only remember what happens in the school playground.In 1999, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic not only lacked ICBMs, but strong international allies who were prepared to stand by his country in its hour of need. Even though the Russian military were champing at the bit to help their historical Slavic allies in Belgrade, Yeltsin and the ruling elite in Russia were purportedly given financial inducements to stay out. Whether or not that is true, a new IMF loan was conveniently agreed just a week after NATO began its illegal aerial bombing campaign.The US only expected military action to last a few days before  Slobo  would cave in and accept the Western military alliance s right to occupy mineral-rich Kosovo and have free unhindered access over the whole of Yugoslavia. I don t see this as a long-term operation. I think this is something that is achievable within a relatively short space of time, boasted Secretary of State Madeline Albright.But Slobo and the stoical Serbs did not cave in. As the bombing campaign continued, splits began to emerge in NATO between the hawks, comprised of the US and Britain, and the countries from continental Europe who favored dialogue with Belgrade.On April 15, 1999, the Guardian reported that American officials rejected a six-point German peace plan which included a 24-hour bombing pause, a United Nations peacekeeping force and civilian monitors. It went on to note how British Prime Minister Tony Blair also gave the plan a polite cold shoulder. NATO atrocities, such as the killing of 16 civilians in the bombing of Serbian State Television   a clear war crime   and the bombing of a passenger train and a convoy of Kosovan Albanians, were beginning to turn public opinion against the  humanitarian  operation. With the war not going to plan, it was time once again for the US to make threats. To increase the pressure on Milosevic- the Yugoslav President was indicted as a war criminal, a process I described here.In addition, hints were made that NATO was planning a ground invasion. President Clinton declared on 18th May 1999 that he would not take any option off the table. Victor Chernomyrdin, Yeltsin s envoy, flew to Belgrade to persuade Milosevic to accept NATO s terms   or face an escalation of the war.But would there really have been boots on the ground or was it one big bluff? Evidence suggests the latter. NATO s supreme commander Wesley Clark revealed in his memoirs that the Alliance s top political leaders had reached no consensus over sending in ground troops. And would NATO have gotten away with intensifying its air campaign? Clark also admitted that by mid-May, NATO had gone about as far as possible with the air strikes. I m sure that seven years later, as he lay in his prison cell a sick man, denied the proper medical treatment which his heart condition required, Milosevic regretted not saying  nyet  to Chernomyrdin in 1999 and calling Washington s bluff.Four years later it was the turn of oil-rich Iraq to be attacked.Saddam Hussein and his Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz repeatedly told the world s media that their country possessed no WMDs.They were accused of lying by western neocons, but the endless war lobby knew the Iraqi leadership was telling the truth. Saddam s country was attacked not because it possessed weapons of mass destruction, but because it didn t. With its air defenses severely weakened after years of Allied bombing, and its own air force decimated in the first Gulf War, Iraq was a sitting duck.  Bush and Blair lied about the country being a threat  and 1m Iraqis eventually died.Over in oil-rich Libya, Muammar Gaddafi drew absolutely the wrong conclusions about what had happened to Iraq. Eagerly seeking the end of US sanctions on his country, he foolishly agreed in December 2003 to eliminate his WMDs program. He should have reacted to  Shock and Awe  by building up his arsenal, but instead, falling for the silver-tongued promises of Western leaders who were going to end his country s isolation, he did the opposite.George W. Bush hailed his decision as a wise and sensible choice. Tony Blair, for his part, said: This courageous decision by Colonel Gaddafi is an historic one. I applaud it. It will make the region and the world more secure. But of course, it didn t. It only paved the way for the destruction of Gaddafi s country by the same countries whose leaders had hailed him as  wise  and  sensible  a few years earlier.Again, I m sure that eight years later, as Gaddafi lay in his underground hideout, trying to escape capture from US-backed  rebels (who eventually killed him in the most brutal way imaginable), he bitterly regretted his decision to disarm.Which brings us back to North Korea.It s clear that Kim Jong-un has seen what happened to Milosevic, Saddam and Gaddafi and the devastation wreaked on their countries and acted accordingly. North Korea s strategy is clearly based on the belief, borne out by events described above, that the US is a bully which only attacks the weak. Thus, saber-rattling and generally playing a  high line  is the best way to avoid attack. We must remember too that North Korea lost around 1m people in the Korean War 1950-53, many from an intensive US bombing campaign.#bbcpm discussing Trump's constitutional authority to attack N. Korea. International law, of course, is not even mentioned.  David Traynier   (@DTraynier) August 11, 2017 We  need nukes to defend ourselves from attack, but it is deemed totally outrageous if countries in the global south, which  we  threaten on a routine basis, seek to acquire such weapons for the same reason.To deter a US attack, North Korea, or indeed any other country in the line of fire, has to convince the serial warmongers in Washington that the cost of launching such an assault would be too high. Being  nice  and singing  Give Peace a Chance  won t cut the mustard. Remember that John Lennon, who wrote and sang that song, lost his life from a gunshot.While Saddam implored the West,  Believe me, I have no WMDs,  Kim Jong-un has done the exact opposite and talked up his country s capabilities. However, Kim knows that words alone are not enough; he also needs to demonstrate that North Korean projectiles can be a threat to the US. Hence the announcement on Wednesday that it was  carefully considering  a plan to fire four missiles into the sea off the island of Guam, home to two US bases.https://twitter.com/PaddyBriggs/status/895547451381346305Of course, Pyongyang s strategy is high risk, especially with such a volatile individual as Donald Trump   who seems desperate to earn neocon approval to avoid a possible impeachment   in The White House.Recent history though suggests that North Korea, by keeping its fists clenched and continuing to indulge in missile  willy-waving  is doing absolutely the right thing. The big lesson of the last thirty years is surely that deterrence works. If you re a  target state  and can t deter the warmongers in Washington, you re in grave danger. Just ask the ghosts of Slobodan Milosevic, Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi.***Follow Neil Clark @NeilClark66READ MORE NORTH KOREA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire North Korea FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV",Middle-east,"August 14, 2017",1
 This North Carolina High School Just Made It So Trans Students Can Be Pepper Sprayed For Peeing,"It s hard to believe that so many people are so remarkably stupid and bigoted in North Carolina, but alas, they really seem to be. Of course, not the entire state, but there does seem to be a rather large group of the population that believes transgender individuals are out to cause harm. When in reality, those who are transgender are actually just living their truth and should be treated with dignity and respect for doing so.With the passage and signing of HB2, better known as the now infamous  bathroom bill,  it s basically given citizens of the state permission to be the bathroom police. To be clear, HB2 has nothing to do with bathroom safety, and everything to do with being discriminatory bigots to the transgender community.Now, because of this legislated discrimination, the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education is now allowing students to bring pepper spray into school bathrooms. You know, to  protect themselves,  which in all honesty just gave permission to every bigoted child in that state to use this allowance as a  get out of jail free card  to those they want to physically abuse by means of pepper spray. Think about it, you can already hear the  I thought they were going to attack me  excuses piling up, and administrators being like,  well, in that case Board member Chuck Hughes, who is in favor of the pepper spray and referenced HB2 in his argument, said: Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, it may be a pretty valuable tool to have on the female students if they go to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in. Keep in mind, this also means that students will seemingly be able to have pepper spray on their person at all times while in school. Surely there will be no complications with such a thing (sarcasm).This school board just made it perfectly fine for students to openly harm transgender individuals. Individuals who just need to use the restroom like everybody else. It s outrageous and should be illegal, but instead, it s openly condoned by even the highest office in the state. Chances are, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory would approve. Disgusting.Featured image via THV11",News,"May 11, 2016",1

Greece plays down financial impact of any F-16 jet deal,"ATHENS (Reuters) - A potential deal with the United States to upgrade dozens of Greece s F-16 fighter jets is not expected to harm its fiscal progress and should not worry its EU lenders, a Greek  government spokesman said on Thursday. Defense spending has been reduced during Greece s seven-year debt crisis, which shrank the size of its economy by more than a quarter and drove its jobless rate to nearly 28 percent.   It (the deal) is not expected to impact in any way the country s progress on fiscal targets or the fiscal balance of its budget,  spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos told reporters. Discussions have progressed but the deal over the Lockheed Martin fighter jets upgrade has not yet been sealed, Tzanakopoulos said. Greece has about 160 F-16 fighter jets. Any deal would involve ugrading about 85 to 95, he added.  The upgrade is not expected to cost more than 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion), a sum which would be paid in annual instalments of about 110 million euros over a decade.  It is the cheapest and most appropriate solution to upgrade our air defense,  he said, adding that Athens has paid dozens of billions euros in past decades to purchase such jets. Greece s current EU bailout programme, its third since 2010, ends in August and the leftist-led government has cut pensions, increased taxes and implemented unpopular reforms to meet targets.   Greek media reported on Thursday that European Union lenders were concerned about the possible arms deal. Asked about the reports, Tzanakopoulos said Athens was ready to provide any information to the Commission.  There is no reason for any concern,  he said.  It is logical that the EU Commission would want to be briefed and it will get all the necessary information, if requested.  The potential deal came to light during Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras s visit to the White House this week. Greece spends about 2 percent of its gross domestic product - roughly 3.5 billion euros - on defence, more than the EU s average, largely due to long-standing tensions with its neighbor and fellow NATO member Turkey. Spending on arms is expected to reach 475 million euros in 2018, according to Greece s 2018 draft budget.    Asked whether Greece, as it emerges from crisis, was returning to past habits of overspending on arms, Tzanakopoulos said:  The government has no intention to reiterate the mistakes of the past.

UK parliament says government must publish secret Brexit impact studies,"LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers ramped up pressure on the government to publish its assessment of the impact Brexit will have on the economy, passing a motion in parliament on Wednesday which could compel the government to release the papers. The government said on Monday it had carried out 58 economic assessments, covering sectors from aerospace to tourism, but has so far refused requests from lawmakers to publish them, saying they could undermine their negotiating position in Brexit talks. That has irked lawmakers - including some from Prime Minister Theresa May s own party - who say the documents should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and used to help shape the public debate around what a good EU exit deal would look like. Parliament agreed a motion stating that the documents should be released to a parliamentary committee. The government did not oppose the motion but it was unclear if its passage would force them to act.  The debate ended in confusion with the Speaker of the House indicating that he believed the government was obliged to comply with the motion, but saying he would wait to see what their response was before acting further.  We take all parliamentary votes seriously and recognize that parliament does have rights relating to the publication of documents,  a Brexit department spokeswoman said.   Ministers also have a clear obligation not to disclose information when doing so would not be in the public interest. We will reflect on the implications of the vote and respond in due course.  Labour said the result was clear and called on Brexit minister David Davis to set a date for the papers  publication.  Labour has been absolutely clear since the referendum that ministers could not withhold vital information from Parliament about the impact of Brexit on jobs and the economy,  said Labour s Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer. Binding or not, a rancorous debate underlined the extent to which May s approach to Brexit is generating dissent in parliament and potentially undermining her ability to rely on its support when passing crucial laws to implement the EU exit.   I m not going to stand by and see the future of my children s generation and the grandchildren which I hope will follow being trashed or ruined without any form of debate and disclosure as to the consequences,  said Anna Soubry, one of several Conservative lawmakers who said they were ready to rebel. The central plank of May s Brexit strategy, a piece of legislation known as the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, will require all May s lawmakers to back her if the minority Conservative government is to avoid making concessions.  A debate on the bill is due to begin on Nov 14. ",worldnews,"October 31, 2017 ",0

LOL! LEFTIST RAG PUBLISHES Story About How President Trump Will Use Racist #HurricaneHarvey To Harm Blacks,"You just can t make this stuff up The leftist rag, Daily Kos actually wrote a story about how President Trump will disproportionately harm blacks after Hurricane Harvey attacks them in Texas.Here is the actual tweet pushing their insane story about a racist Hurricane Harvey:Hurricane Harvey poised to disproportionately impact blacks in Texas, but no one is talking about it https://t.co/A6JrT6CYUp  Daily Kos (@dailykos) August 25, 2017Here s an excerpt from the article:As Texas braces itself for Hurricane Harvey, the Trump administration remains woefully ignorant and unprepared. The current FEMA director is working to rewrite the Federal Flood Insurance Program so that the federal government bears less of the cost when disasters strike and flooding occurs. On the surface, that might sound like a fiscally responsible move. But it s loaded with inconsistencies and will most certainly not work out well for local cities, states or residents. Additionally, since Trump seems to be firing people weekly but taking his sweet time in hiring them, no one has been appointed to lead both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS oversees FEMA and the Coast Guard so it s almost guaranteed that the response to this storm will be chaos. This is shaping up to be another Hurricane Katrina complete with a devastating impact on black and brown communities.Southeast Texas and the coastal bend regions of the state are expected to be the hardest hit. While Hispanics make up about 40 percent of the state s population, Texas has one of the largest black populations in the country. And they live concentrated in the areas that are predicted to be hardest hit. For example, several counties have already been declared a state of disaster by Republican Gov. Greg AbbottNoteworthy also is the high percentage of people in poverty [in Texas] who are African American women, especially single parents. Of the 24% of African Americans below poverty level, single mothers make up 65%. Daily Kos",politics,"Aug 25, 2017",1

 Gov. Chris Christie Bails On Cop’s Funeral To Campaign For Trump,"Governor Chris Christie wasted no time after suspending his presidential campaign to swoon over Donald Trump, the clear favorite to win the Republican Presidential nomination, in hopes his support would result in improving his own public image in the Republican Party, with an eye on a position in Trump s presidential administration.On Monday, Governor Chris Christie should have been in New Jersey to attend the funeral of 31-year-old New Jersey State Trooper Sean Cullen, who was killed in the line of duty last week after being struck by a vehicle in response to a highway car fire. Instead, Governor Christie is ignoring his duties as Governor to be a full-time surrogate for Donald Trumps  presidential campaign, as Christie was in Florida campaigning on Trump s behalf.Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno attended the funeral in place of Governor Christie, who referred questions about his scheduling to the Trump campaign, who, not surprisingly, did not reply to the media s requests for comment on the issue.This is the third police funeral Governor Christie has missed since December. It is disgraceful that a public official elected by the people is ignoring the public servicemen who sacrificed themselves in the line of duty.The president of the state troopers  union, Christopher Burgos, criticized Governor Christie for his actions. We are focused on honoring our fallen brother today, and quite frankly we did not expect someone who has consistently shown disdain for law enforcement to pay his respects to the Cullen and State Police family, said Burgos to Politico New Jersey. May Sean rest in peace. A wonderful family. Tragic,  he said.  Gov s decision making is predicated on selfish political opportunism, that much is clear. 1,000 officers attended the funeral to mourn the fallen New Jersey State Trooper. He orders flags flown at half-mast, but couldn t stay for the funeral?  New Jersey state Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat, told New York Daily News .  It s a choice that symbolizes how he feels about the State of New Jersey. It isn t even his campaign. Featured image via Flickr",News,"March 15, 2016",1
"JUST IN: Obama Campaign Secretly Paid $972,000 To Fund Creation Of Fake Trump Dossier","Well, well, well As a famous  reverend  once said, Obama s  chickens have come home too roost OR AS MIKE HUCKABEE SAID:.@GovMikeHuckabee: I think it's easier to find Bigfoot and Amelia Earhart than it is to find collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/RA68QqD9kG  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 29, 2017Obama for America (OFA), the former president s political organization, has directed nearly a million dollars to the very same law firm that funneled money to Fusion GPS, the firm behind the infamous Steele dossier.Since April of 2016, Obama For America (OFA) has paid over $972,000 to Perkins Coie, records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show.The Washington Post reported last week that Perkins Coie, an international law firm, was directed by both the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s campaign to retain Fusion GPS in April of 2016 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump. Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, to compile a dossier of allegations that Trump and his campaign actively colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. Though many of the claims in the dossier have been directly refuted, none of the dossier s allegations of collusion have been independently verified. Lawyers for Steele admitted in court filings last April that his work was not verified and was never meant to be made public.FEC records as well as federal court records show that Marc Elias, the Perkins Coie lawyer whom the Washington Post reported was responsible for the payments to Fusion GPS on behalf of Clinton s campaign and the DNC, also previously served as a counsel for OFA. In Shamblin v. Obama for America, a 2013 case in federal court in Florida, federal court records list Elias as simultaneously serving as lead attorney for both OFA and the DNC.OFA, which managed Obama s successful re-election campaign in 2012, retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president s agenda during his final term in office. The group reorganized again after the 2016 election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose President Donald Trump. During the entire 2016 campaign cycle, the group spent only $4.5 million, according to FEC records.Federal records show that Hillary Clinton s official campaign organization, Hillary For America, paid just under $5.1 million to Perkins Coie in 2016. The DNC paid nearly $5.4 million to the law firm in 2016.The timing and nature of the payments to Perkins Coie by Obama s official campaign arm raise significant questions about whether OFA was funding Fusion GPS, how much Obama and his team knew about the contents and provenance of the dossier long before its contents were made public, and whether the president or his government lieutenants knowingly used a partisan political document to justify official government actions targeting the president s political opponents named in the dossier. According to the Washington Post, Fusion GPS was first retained by Perkins Coie on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in April of 2016.At the same time that Hillary s campaign, Obama s campaign organization, and the DNC were simultaneously paying Perkins Coie, the spouse of one of Fusion GPS s key employees was working directly for Obama in the West Wing. Shailagh Murray, a former Washington Post reporter-turned-political operative, was serving as a top communications adviser to Obama while the Obama administration was reportedly using information from the dossier to justify secret surveillance of Trump campaign staff. Murray is married to Neil King, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was hired by Fusion GPS in December of 2016. While at the Wall Street Journal, King worked alongside Fusion GPS s core team, even sharing bylines with Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS executive who personally hired Steele to probe Trump s alleged Russia connections.As you might suspect,  Neil King was a thick as thieves with CNN, the WSJ and the Washington Post. The lines between investigating the truth and fake news were blurred in a big way when King and Catan jumped from the WSJ to Fusion GPS. As the Daily Caller reported:CNN s reporting on the Trump-Russia dossier has left out at least one crucial fact: the close ties between the network and the opposition research firm at the center of the dossier controversy.CNN s reporting on the dossier, led by justice correspondent Evan Perez, has been favorable to the firm, Fusion GPS, and hyped the dossier s credibility. Left out of Perez s reporting, which has relied largely on unnamed sources, is his personal closeness to Fusion GPS  operatives. Fusion has repeatedly been described in Senate testimonies as a smear-for-hire operation that manufactures misleading or false media narratives for its clients. Another Fusion founder, Tom Catan, worked as a reporter for the Journal at the same time as Perez and Simpson. The third Fusion co-founder, Peter Fritsch, worked above Perez and Simpson as the senior national security editor.KING (FUSION GPS) ON THE RIGHT -Photo posted on Facebook by Perez (CNN)Simpson and Fritsch left the WSJ in 2011 to launch Fusion. Perez jumped from the paper to CNN in 2013. Another longtime Journal reporter, Neil King, left the paper to join Fusion in December 2016.PEREZ ( LEFT) AND ALL OF FUSION The importance of the fake dossier and how it was shopped around to the press comes into focus when you realize that Obama, Clinton and the DNC had Fusion GPS create this smear campaign on Trump. This also opened the door for the phony Russia collusion investigation whereby the Trump campaign and family members were spied on because of something fake.Read more: The Federalist ",politics,"Oct 29, 2017",1
Ecuador president removed as head of ruling party as feud deepens,"QUITO (Reuters) - Ecuador s ruling Country Alliance party, founded by former president Rafael Correa over a decade ago, has removed President Lenin Moreno as its head, citing  repeated failures  in leadership, as a schism between the former allies deepens. The Country Alliance party, which has been divided by the two politicians, late on Tuesday announced that Correa ally Ricardo Patino, a former foreign minister, would replace Moreno as party leader.  The head of the national Country Alliance party has unanimously decided,  it said in a statement announcing  the immediate removal of Lenin Moreno as president of the Country Alliance party.  Ecuador s government, however, said it did not recognize the decision and stressed Moreno remained the head of the party.   Country Alliance is a political party, not an estate ... These actions are wrong and do not reflect the feeling of our political base,  acting vice president Alejandra Vicuna told journalists on Tuesday. Moreno, a Correa prot g  who previously served as his vice president, was elected earlier this year to succeed the fiery leftist. At the time, opposition critics warned Moreno would be a puppet of political heavyweight Correa, whom they accused of seeking to stage a presidential comeback in 2021. But Moreno, a paraplegic former United Nations special envoy on disability, has stunned the Andean country of around 17 million by quickly breaking with Correa, who is now living abroad, in his wife s home country of Belgium.      Moreno, who is seeking presidential term limits via a referendum to revise the constitution, has sidelined another top Correa ally from the vice presidency, and is overseeing a corruption probe that has ensnared former high-level officials. Vicuna replaced Jorge Glas, who was also Correa s vice president, after Glas came under investigation in a corruption scandal centered on Brazilian construction company Odebrecht. He is currently in jail. Polls indicate Moreno has widespread popular support in Ecuador. His approval levels have jumped from around 66 percent in May, when he was sworn in, to about 77 percent in September, a recent survey by local pollster Cedatos showed.  Many Ecuadoreans report being satisfied with his attempts to investigate corruption and boost social welfare. His conciliatory temperament is also welcomed by some who were tired of Correa s confrontational style. ",worldnews,"November 1, 2017 ",0
Pressure on as Xi's 'Belt and Road' enshrined in Chinese party charter,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping s vast  Belt and Road  infrastructure project was unexpectedly included in the ruling Communist Party s constitution on Tuesday, giving it greater policy heft and added pressure to succeed. The party s amended charter, approved at the close of its twice-a-decade congress, pledged to  pursue the Belt and Road initiative , a further sign of Xi s expanding power and evidence that the ambitious  Silk Road -like initiative will endure beyond Xi s tenure. It also underscores how the Communist Party has increased its attention to foreign policy and reflects Xi s growing desire for China to take a global leadership role, analysts said.  Everyone knows that the Belt and Road is very important to Xi, it has his personal stamp and authority,  said Peter Cai, a non-resident fellow at Sydney-based think tank Lowy Institute.  But to have major policy, especially an external engagement policy, to be written into a party constitution, at least in recent memory, it is something quite significant,  he said. First mentioned during a speech Xi gave to university students in Kazakhstan in 2013, the plan is a vehicle for China to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries. Xi has heavily promoted the initiative, inviting world leaders to Beijing in May for an inaugural summit at which he pledged $124 billion ( 94 billion) in funding for the plan. Local Chinese governments as well as state and private firms have rushed to offer support by investing overseas and making loans.  Some critics argue that China is exporting excess industrial capacity to spread its influence, and that the initiative, which has seen developing countries take on heavy debt, needs higher standards of governance and transparency.  China has made commitments and pledges to many developing countries and it will take that length of time, 10 years or more, to complete the initiative,  said Rajiv Biswas, Asia Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit.  This has also strengthened China s soft power globally, so it wouldn t make sense for China s point of view to suddenly pull away from all of this,  he said.   Other analysts said its inclusion could be a double-edged sword that adds pressure for the initiative, which remains broadly defined and leaves much to interpretation, to succeed.  The danger of having given it greater visibility is that actually there are going to be more of those efforts to play to the policy in a political way rather than considering carefully the costs and benefits of each portion of what one is doing,  said Dali Yang, a professor at the University of Chicago. Many private investors have jumped on the bandwagon to describe their projects as Belt and Road-related, while local governments have rolled out individual Belt and Road plans.  The heads of Chinese firms including China Communications Construction Co and China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation [SASAAI.UL] told Reuters during the week-long congress that they would place greater focus on developing their overseas businesses in support of the Belt and Road initiative. The party congress saw Xi cement his power ahead of a second five-year term and put him in the same company as the founder of modern China, Mao Zedong, with the enshrinement of his political thought into the country s constitution.

 Dallas Police Chief Tells Congress To Shove Their Thoughts And Prayers: ‘Do Your Jobs!’ (VIDEO),"It started out as an observation, then it turned into a joke, and but it s become downright insulting. Each time America suffers from another horrific mass shooting, Republicans in Congress send their  thoughts and prayers  and do absolutely nothing else. Rather than work towards solutions, conservative politicians have found that merely saying a prayer before bed somehow absolves them of their reprehensible inaction towards gun violence.And Dallas Police Chief David Brown, like so many of us, is absolutely fed up.At a press conference updating the country about the investigation into the ambush of police officers in Dallas following a peaceful anti-police brutality march, he didn t remain silent about the culpability of Congress. In short, Chief Brown has had a lot of long days trying to fulfill his obligation to the public and get answers, but he s noticed lawmakers can t say the same. It s been business as usual   and that means no business on finding solutions to mass shootings.Dallas Police Chief Brown to Congress:  Do your job  pic.twitter.com/rhhoWPKSVX  Colin Jones (@colinjones) July 11, 2016Brown is not alone. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings (D) recently pointed out something that conservatives had hoped would go unnoticed: Open Carry, the movement that allows Texans the right to carry AR-15s nearly anywhere in public, didn t help during the police ambush, and actually made everything much, much worse. Rawlings said Dallas police Chief David Brown told him that people running through the shooting scene with rifles and body armor required officers to track them down and bring them to the police department.  Whether that was time that could have been spent trying to find and stop the shooter is something police will have to comment on. Major Max Geron of the Dallas PD didn t mind answering that question:  There was also the challenge of sorting out witnesses from potential suspects. Texas is an open carry state, and there were a number of armed demonstrators taking part. There was confusion on the radio about the description of the suspects and whether or not one or more was in custody. Dallas police have every right to feel frustrated and sickened by the response from both their state Republican Party and the ones in Washington, D.C. Law enforcement agencies have repeatedly warned pro-gun lawmakers that these fanatical pushes to put guns in every citizen s hands and in every corner of public life means putting both civilians and cops at risk. It makes policing harder. It makes mass murder easier. And it makes the lines between  good guy with a gun  and  bad guy with a gun  impossible to separate.To be clear, Democrats need to bear some responsibility for inaction as well. After massacres at Sandy Hook and Aurora, there was motivation from Americans to finally fix this problem   and Democrats let it slip through their fingers. Following Orlando, progressive lawmakers seemed to show signs that enough was enough, but they need to keep at it.The way forward is simple: Congress needs to put the lives of American citizens above the  rights  of an AR-15.

 Lawyers Trump Used To ‘Prove’ He Has No Russia Connection Won ‘Russia Law Firm Of The Year’ In 2016,"It was the tweet that blew up the internet:BREAKING: Trump lawyer: Tax returns from past 10 years show no ""income of any type from Russian sources,"" with few exceptions.  The Associated Press (@AP) May 12, 2017The headscratching claim by Trump s lawyers was that he had  no income of any type  from Russia  with few exceptions.The exceptions cited don t raise many eyebrows. What is noticeably absent is any mention of the Russia megadonors Eric Trump recently bragged helped finance Trump s golf resort, leading one to assume that there are things being intentionally left out of this report. (Eric Trump now denies making this admission, unfortunately Eric has been known to lie before.)The follow up story published by the Associated Press was even more bizarre (emphasis added).President Donald Trump s lawyers say a review of his last 10 years of tax returns do not reflect  any income of any type from Russian sources,  with some exceptions.The lawyers did not release copies of Trump s tax returns so The Associated Press cannot independently verify their conclusions.So Trump s lawyers  reviewed  Trump s tax returns and   surprise   found that he is completely innocent of any wrongdoing. But they won t let reporters independently verify those findings. So we just have to take their word for it If that s the case, then the law firm doing the investigation better have an absolutely impeccable record. Instead, Trump got one that has even more connections than he (allegedly!) does.The lawyers Trump turned to work for a firm called Morgan Lewis. It does a lot of business in Russia. It does so much business in Russia, in fact, that it actually nabbed a prestigious award for being  Russia Law Firm of the Year  in 2016.The law firm that sent the letter RE: Trump's biz interests in Russia was recognized as ""Russia Law Firm of the Year"" in 2016: pic.twitter.com/t7yBFpl1Hn  Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) May 12, 2017Others argue the law firm is merely a victim of its own success. It s a global company, of course it would be in Russia.Trump letter is dumb for other reasons, but not this. Morgan Lewis & Bockius is one of the biggest & most well-known lawfirms in the world. https://t.co/gBeg7Ms0EP  Jeff B/DDHQ (@EsotericCD) May 12, 2017However, this needn t be a massive conspiracy. Something worth thinking about: This group   which has a vested interest in not upsetting Trump and Putin   wants us to take their word at facevalue when they say that Trump is completely innocent. The very fact that they have business relationships and clients in Russia means they would feel pressured to tread lightly. Russia, a country run not only by Putin but a collective of oligarchs, can destroy your business if they feel antagonized by what you re doing.Making matters even more shady, Trump s lawyers claim they just released these findings at the behest of a congressional request. But the letter they sent is two months old. If it were that old, it may explain why Trump s lawyers didn t bother to mention Trump s Russian golf course investors. They didn t think it would come out. News of that relationship only leaked in the past few weeks.But there s an easy way to clear all this up: Trump could always release his tax returns to the public.Featured image via AFP-OUT",News,"May 12, 2017",1

USA TODAY Caught Fabricating Story About Innocent “Dreamer” Being Deported…Here’s The Truth [VIDEO],"More fake news pushing a leftist agenda If you read the USA Today report of Juan Manuel Montes being deported you might believe their headline:  First Protected Dreamer Deported Under Trump USA Today reported Tuesday that an illegal immigrant protected by Barack Obama s amnesty was deported in February after spending an evening with his girlfriend. However, a Department of Homeland Security spokesman told The Daily Caller that this story is false because Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez did not receive amnesty and was caught climbing over a border fence when he was detained.  Conservative TreehouseThe USA Today story said that Bojorquez, 23, was apprehended by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents while he was waiting for a car ride to pick him up.According to the article, he told the officers he left his wallet in his friend s car and, because he didn t have his ID or proof of his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, he was deported. Within three hours, he was back in Mexico, becoming the first undocumented immigrant with active DACA status deported by the Trump administration s stepped-up deportation policy,  the USA Today reporters wrote.The Trump administration has said it will continue honoring the over 750,000 illegal immigrants who receive DACA, but this incident, if accurate, would have been a departure from that policy. David Lapan, a DHS spokesman, told TheDC,  Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez was apprehended by the Calexico Station Border Patrol after illegally entering the U.S. by climbing over the fence in downtown Calexico. He was arrested by BP just minutes after he made his illegal entry and admitted under oath during the arrest interview that he had entered illegally. The spokesman added,  His DACA status expired in Aug. 2015 and he was notified at that time. In addition, he has a conviction for theft for which he received probation.  Daily CallerFrom USA Today: Federal agents ignored President Trump s pledge to protect from deportation undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children by sending a young man back to his native Mexico, the first such documented case, a USA TODAY examination of the new administration s immigration policies shows.After spending an evening with his girlfriend in Calexico, Calif., on Feb. 17, Juan Manuel Montes, 23, who has lived in the U.S. since age 9, grabbed a bite and was waiting for a ride when a U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer approached and started asking questions.Montes was twice granted deportation protections under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program created by President Barack Obama and left intact by President Trump.Montes had left his wallet in a friend s car, so he couldn t produce his ID or proof of his DACA status and was told by agents he couldn t retrieve them. Within three hours, he was back in Mexico, becoming the first undocumented immigrant with active DACA status deported by the Trump administration s stepped-up deportation policy. Some people told me that they were going to deport me; others said nothing would happen,  Montes told USA TODAY in his aunt and uncle s home in western Mexico where he s been staying.  I thought that if I kept my nose clean nothing would happen.  He asked that the exact location of their home be withheld.Yet Trump declined to revoke the DACA protections Obama had granted to more than 750,000 undocumented immigrants, repeatedly saying he had a soft spot for these young people who are leading productive lives and have few, if any, ties to the countries of their birth. They shouldn t be very worried,  he told ABC News in January.  I do have a big heart. Even so, DACA enrollees are being targeted by immigration authorities.At least 10 are in federal custody, according to United We Dream, an advocacy organization made up of DACA enrollees and other young immigrants.The group s advocacy director, Greisa Martinez, who has DACA protection, said Montes  case is proof that people like herself are at risk despite what Trump said.For entire story: USA Today ",politics,"Apr 18, 2017",1
Facebook Partners With Snopes & Other So-Called ‘Fact Checking’ Sites to Burry ‘Fake News’,"21st Century Wire says Facebook is partnering with Snopes.com and other sites which have apparently been unofficially deemed the new ministries of truth to decide what is and what is not  Fake News.  Do we trust these agencies more than we trust the intelligence of 21WIRE Facebook followers to discern, on their own, what is  Fake News  and what is credible  Absolutely not.You decide: Is Facebook really cracking down on fake news or is it making it easier for the establishment to burry stories from one of the most widely used sources of news link sharing on the internet? Alex Heath Business InsiderFacebook is going to start fact checking, labeling, and burying fake news and hoaxes in the News Feed, the company announced on Thursday.The decision comes after Facebook received heated criticism for its role in spreading a deluge of political misinformation during the U.S. presidential election, like one story that falsely said the Pope had endorsed Donald Trump.To combat fake news, Facebook has partnered with a shortlist of media organizations, including Snopes and ABC News, that are part of an international fact-checking network led by Poynter, a nonprofit school for journalism located in St. Petersburg, Florida.Starting as a test with a small percentage of its users in the United States, Facebook will make it easier to report news stories that are fake or misleading. Once third-party fact checkers have confirmed that the story is fake, it will be labeled as such and demoted in the News Feed.A company spokesperson told Business Insider that the social network will also use other signals, like algorithms that detect whether a story that appears fake is going viral, to determine if it should label the story as fake and bury it in peoples  feeds. We ve focused our efforts on the worst of the worst, on the clear hoaxes spread by spammers for their own gain, and on engaging both our community and third party organizations,  Facebook News Feed chief Adam Mosseri said in a company blog post on Thursday.A team of Facebook researchers will also review website domains and send sites that appear to be fake or spoofed (like  washingtonpost.co ) to third-party fact checkers, a Facebook spokesperson said. Of the 42 news organizations that have committed to Poynter s fact-checking code of ethics, Facebook is starting out with the following four Snopes, Factcheck.org, ABC News, and PolitiFact. We are only involved to the extent that Facebook relies on the list of signatories to our code of principles as a starting point for the organizations it chooses to verify,  a Poynter spokesperson told Business Insider.

" Chaffetz’s Decision To Quit Means Big Trouble For Trump, And Here’s Exactly How","Congressman Jason Chaffetz s decision to leave Congress means that bad things really are on the way for President Trump. If his presidency lasts the year, I will be shocked. I will eat a hat if that happens.Chaffetz has been a real star in the GOP. He is known for his ambition. Last November, he won about 74 percent of the vote in his district. He s young. He s good looking. He knows how to get all the right press and do what he needs to do to get ahead. Nothing in his actions in the past would indicate he wanted to leave Washington, DC. At least not yet. Rumors have been going around that he had his eyes on Senator Orrin Hatch s (R-UT) seat or possibly the governor s mansion in Utah. No one expected him to leave Congress so soon after winning reelection by such a large margin.At the same time, the Congressman has not been a true believer in Trump. Last fall, after the now infamous Billy Bush tape was released, he told ABC News,  I don t plan on voting for Donald Trump   this is quite the quandary what the nation s going to have to figure out. I m out, I can t support Trump after his lewd comments.  He went on to talk about his daughters and how he could not defend what Trump said about women. He later went back on that and said that he hated what Trump did but Hillary Clinton was just so much worse.At the start of 2017, things were looking good for the young Utah politician. Chaffetz was still the chairman of the powerful House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform. He had a fellow  Republican  in the White House. His Party had the House, the Senate and the White House. I can imagine him dreaming of all of the legislation he could push through this way.And then it all went wrong. Trump is not a real Republican. He has no real ideology. His only real allegiances are to his own ego and self interest. The things he says and promises he makes are valid only as long as he is voicing them. They then disappear into the proverbial ether. They have no meaning.This wasn t the problem, however. Since Inauguration Day, there have been more complaints and problems with the Trump Administration. Trump s ties to Russia are more than problematic, they could be treasonous. His financial dealings may not meet violations of law, he cannot have conflicts of interest legally. He can have them. He admitted in 2015 that he had a  big conflict of interest with Turkey because I have a hotel in Istanbul.  His frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago mean that the government is paying him every week to stay at his resort. He is still benefitting from all of his businesses and there is no reason to believe foreign leaders car a wit about the Emolument Clause. And these are just a few of the scandals that should be investigated by a committee like the one Chaffetz now heads.This has put Chaffetz in a really tough spot. He has access to information we all do not. If all of what do do know is as bad as it is, one only can wonder what things he has seen. On one hand, he cannot just step down from this committee. He cannot start investigations of a president in his own Party, especially if he knows they will blow it up. He also cannot be a party to Trump s misdeeds.This month, Chaffetz found his exit strategy. Quit Congress. He has done it slowly. First, he announces he will not seek reelection. Next, he hints that he may not serve out his term. His next move will be to quit all together. By August, he will be back in Utah. He has already taken several web domains like www.chaffetz2018.com. He claimed he wanted to be with his wife and children and that was why he was leaving. Keep in mind, his children have lived at home while he has been in Congress. That s ten years away from his kids when they lived at his house in Utah. By the summer, they will all be out of his house. So, this is when he goes back to see them more? Just after they all leave his home? No.Chaffetz sees the writing on the wall and does not want to be taken down by the same scandal that will end the Trump train wreck.Chaffetz isn t alone in this thinking. It was reported earlier this spring that Michael Steele, former chair of the RNC has been telling his clients to  start getting close to Pence. Former chairman of RNC Steele told WWR at lunch that .@RealDonaldTrump will not finish his term; advises clients to bolster ties w/VP Pence  West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) March 31, 2017Vice President Mike Pence has the same thought. His is a true believer Evangelical Christian. He once voted to take money away from HIV/AIDS funding to give it to  pray away the gay  programs. He does not go to events with women when alcohol is served, unless his wife is there. He has said he is worried he will  be tempted.  He made female staffers leave early so he would not be alone in the office with then. He could not have liked the comments that Trump grabbed women  by the pussy. Chaffetz had a bright future at the beginning of the year and the only way to make that still happen is to get the hell out of Dodge. So that s what he s doing.Featured image via Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images",News,"April 22, 2017",1
Senate Intelligence panel will see Comey Trump memos,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday they had reached an agreement that would allow them to see memos written by former FBI Director James Comey about his meetings with President Donald Trump. Comey’s relationship with Trump has been central to ongoing investigations of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Trump associates and Moscow. Lawmakers have raised questions about whether Trump fired Comey on May 9 in order to interfere with the Russia probe. Russia has denied such assertions. Trump, a Republican, has dismissed them as sour grapes voiced by Democrats disappointed by his victory and called them a “witch hunt.” “We have a commitment to get appropriate access to the Comey memos,” Senator Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat, told reporters at the Senate. “I’m pleased. I think it’s critical information that we have to have as part of our review process.” He said he expected to have the memos “soon.” Warner declined to say much about the progress of the investigation or provide a timeline for when it might be concluded. “I would have thought we would have been further along, but I would never have expected the administration to fire Jim Comey. You can’t make this stuff up,” he said. When asked, he said he expected that Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser, Jared Kushner, would appear before the committee as promised despite having recently hired a lawyer. Politico first reported that Richard Burr, the committee’s Republican chairman, said the panel would be obtaining memos Comey wrote documenting his conversations with Trump. Comey testified to the intelligence committee this month that he decided to keep detailed records because he felt so uncomfortable after meetings with the president that he feared Trump might lie about them. The Russia investigations, by Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller and congressional committees, have dogged the first months of Trump’s presidency and distracted from his policy goals such as repealing President Barack Obama’s healthcare law. Trump has also faced criticism from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats over his administration’s failure to do more to investigate charges that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election and concerns that it might do so again. “Russia’s our most dangerous adversary in the world today, and if he continues to refuse to act, it’s a dereliction of the basic duty to defend the country,” Nicholas Burns, an undersecretary of state under Republican President George W. Bush, testified to the Senate panel on Wednesday.  At a hearing last week that focused on the U.S. election, a Homeland Security official testified that Russian hackers targeted 21 U.S. state election systems in the 2016 presidential race and that a small number were breached. Warner said the panel had asked officials in 21 states to release information about the hacking. “I do not see how Americans are made safer when they do not know which state elections systems Russia tried to hack,” he said. The probes have at times come up against Republican concerns about leaks of classified information and unproven assertions by Trump and others that Obama’s administration improperly spied on Trump associates. On Wednesday, Republican Senators Chuck Grassley and Lindsey Graham asked the FBI and Justice Department for copies of applications to the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for permission to conduct surveillance related to the election, including any related to the FBI’s ongoing Russia investigation.

U.S. mounts air strike against al Shabaab militants in Somalia,"MOGADISHU (Reuters) - The United States military has carried out an air strike in Somalia against al Shabaab, an al Qaeda-linked Islamist insurgency that wants to topple the U.N.-backed government, the U.S. Africa Command said on Wednesday. It said  several militants  were killed in the strike 60 miles northwest of the capital, Mogadishu, on Tuesday at about 1500 GMT. It was coordinated with the Somali government, AfriCom said in a statement.  Al Shabaab has publicly committed to planning and conducting attacks against the U.S. and our partners in the region,  AfriCom said.  Earlier this month, the U.S. warned of a threat to its diplomatic staff in Mogadishu and directed all non-essential staff to leave the capital. Al Shabaab was pushed out of Mogadishu in 2011 and has lost control of most of Somalia s cities and towns. But the group retains a strong presence in the south and center and can still carry out major attacks. It was blamed for bombings in Mogadishu last month that killed more than 350 people. The group aims to topple Somalia s government, drive out African Union peacekeeping troops and impose its own harsh interpretation of Islamic law.  ",worldnews,"November 15, 2017 ",0
IRAQ 1991: US Carpet Bombs ‘Highway of Death’,"ROAR MagI want to give testimony on what are called the  highways of death. These are the two Kuwaiti roadways, littered with remains of 2,000 mangled Iraqi military vehicles, and the charred and dismembered bodies of tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers, who were withdrawing from Kuwait on February 26th and 27th 1991 in compliance with UN resolutions.US planes trapped the long convoys by disabling vehicles in the front, and at the rear, and then pounded the resulting traffic jams for hours.  It was like shooting fish in a barrel,  said one US pilot. The horror is still there to see.On the inland highway to Basra is mile after mile of burned, smashed, shattered vehicles of every description   tanks, armored cars, trucks, autos, fire trucks, according to the March 18, 1991, Time magazine. On the sixty miles of coastal highway, Iraqi military units sit in gruesome repose, scorched skeletons of vehicles and men alike, black and awful under the sun, says the Los Angeles Times of March 11, 1991. While 450 people survived the inland road bombing to surrender, this was not the case with the 60 miles of the coastal road. There for 60 miles every vehicle was strafed or bombed, every windshield is shattered, every tank is burned, every truck is riddled with shell fragments. No survivors are known or likely. The cabs of trucks were bombed so much that they were pushed into the ground, and it s impossible to see if they contain drivers or not. Windshields were melted away, and huge tanks were reduced to shrapnel. Even in Vietnam I didn t see anything like this. It s pathetic,  said Major Bob Nugent, an Army intelligence officer. This one-sided carnage, this racist mass murder of Arab people, occurred while White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater promised that the US and its coalition partners would not attack Iraqi forces leaving Kuwait. This is surely one of the most heinous war crimes in contemporary history. The Iraqi troops were not being driven out of Kuwait by US troops as the Bush administration maintains. They were not retreating in order to regroup and fight again. In fact, they were withdrawing, they were going home, responding to orders issued by Baghdad, announcing that it was complying with Resolution 660 and leaving Kuwait. At 5:35 p.m. (Eastern standard Time) Baghdad radio announced that Iraq s Foreign Minister had accepted the Soviet cease-fire proposal and had issued the order for all Iraqi troops to withdraw to postions held before August 2, 1990 in compliance with UN Resolution 660. President Bush responded immediately from the White House saying (through spokesman Marlin Fitzwater) that  there was no evidence to suggest the Iraqi army is withdrawing. In fact, Iraqi units are continuing to fight. . . We continue to prosecute the war.  On the next day, February 26, 1991, Saddam Hussein announced on Baghdad radio that Iraqi troops had, indeed, begun to withdraw from Kuwait and that the withdrawal would be complete that day. Again, Bush reacted, calling Hussein s announcement  an outrage  and  a cruel hoax. Eyewitness Kuwaitis attest that the withdrawal began the afternoon of February 26, 1991 and Baghdad radio announced at 2:00 AM (local time) that morning that the government had ordered all troops to withdraw. The massacre of withdrawing Iraqi soldiers violates the Geneva Conventions of 1949, Common Article III, which outlaws the killing of soldiers who are out of combat. The point of contention involves the Bush administration s claim that the Iraqi troops were retreating to regroup and fight again. Such a claim is the only way that the massacre which occurred could be considered legal under international law. But in fact the claim is false and obviously so. The troops were withdrawing and removing themselves from combat under direct orders from Baghdad that the war was over and that Iraq had quit and would fully comply with UN resolutions. To attack the soldiers returning home under these circumstances is a war crime.Iraq accepted UN Resolution 660 and offered to withdraw from Kuwait through Soviet mediation on February 21, 1991. A statement made by George Bush on February 27, 1991, that no quarter would be given to remaining Iraqi soldiers violates even the US Field Manual of 1956. The 1907 Hague Convention governing land warfare also makes it illegal to declare that no quarter will be given to withdrawing soldiers. On February 26,199 I, the following dispatch was filed from the deck of the USS. Ranger, under the byline of Randall Richard of the Providence Journal: Air strikes against Iraqi troops retreating from Kuwait were being launched so feverishly from this carrier today that pilots said they took whatever bombs happened to be closest to the flight deck. The crews, working to the strains of the Lone Ranger theme, often passed up the projectile of choice . . . because it took too long to load. New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd wrote,  With the Iraqi leader facing military defeat, Mr. Bush decided that he would rather gamble on a violent and potentially unpopular ground war than risk the alternative: an imperfect settlement hammered out by the Soviets and Iraqis that world opinion might accept as tolerable. In short, rather than accept the offer of Iraq to surrender and leave the field of battle, Bush and the US military strategists decided simply to kill as many Iraqis as they possibly could while the chance lasted Continue this story at ROAR MagazineREAD MORE IRAQ NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Iraq Files",Middle-east,"April 3, 2016",1
Why Do Hillary And Barack Choose Islam Over Christianity Every Time?,"The always brilliant Ben Shapiro answers that question in well, a brilliant way On Tuesday, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the American woman most responsible for the current refugee crisis in the Middle East, blasted Republicans for not wanting to accept unvetted Syrian Muslim refugees in the aftermath of last week s Paris terror attacks.She tweeted:We've seen a lot of hateful rhetoric from the GOP. But the idea that we'd turn away refugees because of religion is a new low. -H  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) November 17, 2015 This, to be sure, is odd. Hillary decrying hateful rhetoric smacks of irony   she despises Republicans so much that she labeled them her enemies during the first Demoratic debate. Furthermore, Hillary is no fighter for religious freedom. In April, she told the Women in the World Summit that  deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed  to allow for abortion. And in the aftermath of the Supreme Court s egregious same-sex marriage decision in June, Hillary explicitly called for the government to force churches to sanction homosexuality, explaining,  Our work won t be finished until every American can not only marry, but live, work, pray, learn and raise a family free from discrimination and prejudice.  Pray   as in attend church  free from discrimination and prejudice. But she s sure hot and bothered about what she terms discrimination against Muslim refugees. This isn t particularly surprising   the entire left has a peculiar soft spot for Islam.That seems weird, given Islamic countries  fundamental rejection of leftist values ranging from same-sex marriage to abortion to women driving. But it isn t so weird when considered in the context of Marxist philosophy, which sees Islam not as a religious philosophy of its own, but as a sort of bizarre cultural outgrowth of poverty. Impoverished people believe weird things, say the Marxists; if we just gave ISIS jobs, they d stop all this nonsense and start behaving like members of the ACLU. Leftists see Islam not as an ideological force converting millions, but as a knee-jerk response to lack of basic living standards.In fact, leftists see all religion this way: as the refuge of the weakminded underclass. As Marx wrote,  Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the opium of the people.  Barack Obama agrees: as he said back in 2008, poor people  get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren t like them. The view that all religious practice is essentially the domain of the exploited would cut in favor of seeing all religious practices as equally worthy of dismissal.But the left prefers Islam to Christianity. They ll fight against anyone drawing pictures of Mohammed, but they ll lose their minds if Christians complain about an  artist  soaking a statue of Jesus in urine.Why do leftists treat Christianity and Islam differently, if both are merely chimerical responses to the vicissitudes of life? Because leftists see Christianity as the creator of Islam s rise, and Christians as the victimizers of Muslims. The Obama State Department won t recognize Christians as victims of incipient Muslim genocide in the Middle East, but President Obama will equate ISIS violence in 2015 with the Crusades and the Spanish Inquisition. President Obama believes, like many on the left, that Western civilization was founded in racism, sexism, homophobia, and other bigotry   and that Christianity, as its wellspring, provided that impetus.Furthermore, Obama believes that Western civilization has exploited the rest of the world, and that it therefore bears culpability for the poverty that gave rise to the Islamic wave. Muslims are benighted victims of poverty; Christianity made them victims of poverty in the first place. Christianity thus bears blood guilt for the sins of Islam, but Islam bears none of its own. As Dinesh D Souza puts it, Obama is an anti-colonialist and believes  that the rich countries got rich by looting the poor countries, and that within the rich countries, plutocratic and corporate elites continue to exploit ordinary citizens.  Taken one step further, those rich countries   Christian countries   exploited non-Christian countries, impoverishing them and opening them to the opium of Islam.How else to explain the left s romance with Islam and simultaneous dismissal of Christianity? How else to explain the left s preoccupation with allowing Muslim refugees into the Christianity-founded West while demanding nothing of Islamic countries which are murdering Christians en masse?Hillary Clinton says it s hateful for Western countries to discriminate in choosing refugees based on religious philosophy. It s far more hateful to suggest that Christianity must bow and scrape before Islam, particularly when Islamic terrorists target non-Muslims the world over.

CAUGHT ON TAPE: HORRIFIC ISLAMIC TERROR IN GERMANY…Terrorist Shouts “Allahu Akbar!”…Children Targeted,"Hey America Are you ready for a leader who says, NO  to unvetted refugees? ****WARNING****GRAPHIC VIDEO*** German Chancellor Angela Merkel has recently admitted that terrorists have managed to infiltrate Europe by passing themselves off as refugees. She said that  in part, the refugee flow was even used to smuggle terrorists. This comes as no surprise to those critics of Europe s massive influx of Muslim immigrants. Indeed, upon hearing the news, many are no doubt jumping out of their seats yelling,  we told you so! Just this last May, Neue Osnabr cke Zeitung, a German news source, reported that Germany s Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) has received 369 tip-offs on possible links between refugees and Muslim extremists. German police announced that at least forty asylum seekers were being investigated for alleged terrorism links. It was reported that Germany s spy chief, Hans Georg Maassen, said that Germany s domestic intelligence agency had obtained  strong evidence that  17 people have arrived under Islamic State instructions.  [Emphasis added.] Furthermore, last month, German authorities announced that 499 Islamists were under surveillance, ostensibly because there is credible evidence that they pose a threat. It is not clear if this figure also includes homegrown Islamists.So we now know for certain that some Islamist terrorists have taken advantage of the massive influx of refugees and have successfully infiltrated Europe   and on ISIS  orders. Furthermore, there are undoubtedly even more pending investigations, and it is certain that many Islamist terrorist cells with refugee connections are operating within Europe as of this writing.The largely Muslim migrants have brought no shortage of problems with them: there have been refugee-caused sexual assaults across European cities, increased radicalization of Muslim circles, a lack of assimilation, persecution of Christian migrants, etc. These problems serve to exasperate the assimilation problems that already plague many second-generation Europeans whose parents are from Muslim-majority countries. Given that European birthrates are generally below replacement levels, and that the massive influx of immigrants is, although stemmed in some quarters, still occurring, these problems will unfortunately only become more acute as time goes by. The late Libyan President Mu amar al-Gaddafi once said, alluding to Muslim immigration to Europe, that the Islamization of Europe would happen without the need for the sword. But he surely didn t expect it would happen as fast as we are witnessing now.Since the vast majority of the refugees are Muslims whose culture clashes with native European ones on several well-known fronts, this influx has naturally resulted in growing anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe. It is reported that nationalist and rightist groups are gaining ascendency With the increase in the number of Islamic terrorist acts happening all around the world, including in the heart of the European Union, Europeans certainly have a right to be worried any encroaching Islamism.Via: Counter Jihad",politics,"Jul 22, 2016",1
NEW TV SHOW HAS COUPLES “Bravely” Putting Their Marriage On The Line By Sleeping With Strangers,"Television just doing their part to contribute to the moral decay of America Sex in a box in front of a studio audience having failed to save American marriages, the TV industry now will attempt to rescue the institution by trying a two-week spouse switch for wedded couples. FYI has greenlighted The Seven Year Switch, an eight-episode series in which married couples  bravely  put their marriage on the line by shacking up with a  new partner  for a couple weeks. Production is underway for the series to premiere this summer.It s named after The Seven Year Itch, the 1955 Broadway play-turned-Billy Wilder movie starring Marilyn Monroe and Tom Ewell. Hopefully that will be lost on most viewers of this series because if they saw it, they re too old to be FYI s target audience   or any network s for that matter.In today s announcement, FYI instead focused on the fact that someone at some point decided seven years marks the point in many marriages at which couples become  restless and dissatisfied  and might wonder why they d signed up with this guy instead of the doctor their mothers wanted them to marry.

They will eat, live and, yes,  sleep  with these total strangers, the network said.As with WE tv s recently pulled-due-to-lousy-ratings reality series Sex Box, relationship experts will help guide the Seven Year Switch couples through the process, FYI said. At the end of what the network explains is a monthlong experiment, each of the married couples will reunite and decide whether to divorce or renew their vows.Gena McCarthy, SVP Programming and Development at FYI, described it as an experiment to determine whether absence really does make the heart grow fonder, sidestepping the whole shacking-up-with-a-stranger part.Via: Deadline.com",left-news,"Apr 24, 2015",1
 WATCH: Morning Joe Hosts HORRIFIED By Trump Adviser’s Ignorance Of Constitution,"Donald Trump tried out a new minion on Sunday in what resulted in an embarrassing and terrifying appearance on all the networks.Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who helped write Trump s apocalyptic and negative inaugural address and the executive order that banned travelers from seven countries from entering the United States, appeared on the Sunday shows to press the same theme over and over again.Miller claimed that the judicial branch has no authority to stand in the way of Trump s national security agenda and that Trump is always  100 percent correct. We do not have judicial supremacy in this country,  Miller said on Fox News Sunday.  We have three co-equal branches of government. It s true that we have three branches of government, but the Constitution clearly made the judicial branch responsible for interpreting the laws and deciding what is and what is not constitutional.Last week, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled against reinstating Trump s executive order, a blistering defeat for his administration.The ruling caused Republicans to make a bill splitting the Ninth Circuit Court a top priority as punishment. And now Trump and his team are trying to undermine the power of the judiciary in retaliation.And that why Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski expressed horror on Monday morning.The Morning Joe hosts could not believe how anti-Constitution Miller was and that Trump actually praised him for it. It s so much worse than I ever thought,  Scarborough said after both reacted to Miller s performance by saying,  Oh my God. Scarborough then proceeded to inform Miller that courts have every right to question what Trump does and gave him a quick lesson about the Constitution. They will be questioned by the court   it s called judicial review. Alexander Hamilton and James Madison wrote about it in the Federalist Papers, it was enshrined in Madison s Constitution. Indeed, Article 3 of the Constitution has been the bedrock of our nation s judiciary since America s founding.Article 3 states:The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish  The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states; between a state and citizens of another state; between citizens of different states; between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.In short, the courts have the final say about what is constitutional and what is not. Trying to undermine the power of the judiciary is a violation of the Constitution.That was the worst performance out of anybody,  Scarborough continued.  That was horrendous, an embarrassment. Go back and read the constitution. The White House has got to stop embarrassing themselves by putting this guy out there. Scarborough concluded that if Trump keeps trying to undermine the judiciary he ll be impeached.Here s the video via Twitter..@JoeNBC on Stephen Miller s weekend performance: That was horrendous and an embarrassment https://t.co/rE5Fxo8AF3  Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) February 13, 2017Donald Trump continues to get more dangerous to our democracy and Constitution every day.

California to expand paid family leave for new parents,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - California will increase the amount of money new parents can receive through the state’s paid family leave program under a bill to be signed on Monday by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, his office said Friday. The measure, passed last month by the state legislature, would increase the amount paid to new parents or people caring for a sick family member to as much as 70 percent of their regular income for the poorest workers, up from 55 percent. Those earning more would still get an increase in payments, to 60 percent from 55 percent. The state also plans to eliminate a seven-day waiting period imposed on receiving the benefits. The legislation aims to help more people take family leave, especially poorer Californians who could not afford to stop work if they only got 55 percent of their regular income, according to the bill’s author Jimmy Gomez, a Democratic assembly member. The program, administered through the state’s disability system, would apply to all parents who take off time from work to bond with a child within one year of birth, adoption or placement as a foster child. It would also provide payments to people who take time to care for seriously ill family members. ",politicsNews,"April 9, 2016 ",0
 Hillary Clinton Gives The Perfect Response To Reince Priebus’ Sexist Tweet,"After GOP candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton wrapped up their appearance on MSNBC s  Commander In Chief  forum, Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, had some very sexist words for Clinton:@HillaryClinton was angry + defensive the entire time   no smile and uncomfortable   upset that she was caught wrongly sending our secrets.  Reince Priebus (@Reince) September 8, 2016The old  she needs to smile more  and  she s too emotional  spiel. Of course, Trump was also defensive (even belittling a female veteran), but you heard nothing from Priebus about it. No, in typical Republican form, the old, angry conservative man decided to attack the qualified woman running because that s just what they do. Naturally, social media tore him to shreds for being a gross misogynist. But it was Hillary Clinton s response, always laced with class and elegance, that took the cake: Actually, that s just what taking the office of President seriously looks like. https://t.co/Pyn92mesom  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 8, 2016And that s how it s done.While the good ol  boys let Trump have a free pass on everything (Matt Lauer has been eviscerated for his handling of the forum), it s Hillary who is blasted, not because of policy disagreements, but because of demeanor, something that would never be said to any man running for the office of presidency.So Trump can praise Putin, blast our generals (and hint at firing them en masse), but god forbid Hillary Clinton takes this forum serious and doesn t smile enough. Thanks for showing the American people where your priorities lie, Republicans. I wonder, will smiling more will keep our troops safe, reward our veterans, avoid war/conflict, and clean up the DOD budget?So the media and the GOP elite focus on smiling, coughing, a pillow on the chair during interviews, and defensive strategy. No wonder Trump is a nominee for President of the United States.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2016",1
China foreign minister to visit Myanmar amid Rohingya crisis,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit Myanmar and Bangladesh from this weekend, his ministry said on Thursday, amid a crisis over Myanmar s treatment of Rohingya Muslims. More than 600,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since late August, driven out by a military counter-insurgency clearance operation in Buddhist-majority Myanmar s Rakhine State. A top U.N. official has described the military s actions as a textbook case of  ethnic cleansing . Myanmar rejects accusations of rights abuses. China has expressed support for what it calls the Myanmar government s efforts to protect stability. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters that Wang would go to Bangladesh and Myanmar this weekend where he would meet his counterparts and exchange views on bilateral ties and issues of mutual regional concern. On Monday and Tuesday, Wang would attend a meeting of Asian and European foreign ministers in the Myanmar capital of Naypyitaw, Geng added. He did not say whether Wang would discuss the Rohingya issue. China and Myanmar have for years maintained close economic and diplomatic relations. The United States and other Western countries have become more engaged with Myanmar in recent years, since it began a transition to civilian government after nearly 50 years of military rule. International concern over the Rohingya situation has grown.

Senator Grassley could be persuaded to hold hearing on Garland,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley opened the door to holding a hearing on President Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland if a majority of senators wish to do so after the Nov. 8 election, in comments posted online Tuesday. Grassley, an Iowa Republican, vowed months ago that the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs would not act this year to consider Garland’s nomination, saying the Republican-majority Senate should not act on a Court nominee until after the new president takes office early next year. But in a town hall meeting Monday in Cherokee, Iowa, Grassley indicated he could be persuaded by a large number of senators to take action in a “lame duck” session between the Nov. 8 election and the inauguration of the new president in January. “If we have the election, and there was a majority of the Senate changed their mind about doing it in the lame duck, as opposed to January 20,  I don’t feel that I could stand in the way of that. But I don’t think I can promote that idea,” he said in a video of his remarks posted online by the American Bridge 21st Century website, which says it is committed to “holding Republicans accountable.” Grassley made a similar point at the Sioux City Iowa Rotary Club, Iowa’s Globe Gazette reported. Garland, a federal appeals court judge, was nominated by Obama, a Democrat, on March 16 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia. Republicans insist that the next president should fill the vacancy, hoping a Republican will win the White House and choose a conservative rather than the centrist Garland. But such an outcome is not assured, with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton currently leading Republican candidate Donald Trump in public opinion polls. A spokeswoman for Grassley, Beth Levine, denied he was shifting his position. She said that in Sioux City Grassley reiterated his stance “that a Supreme Court nominee wouldn’t be considered until after the next president is sworn in so the American people have an opportunity to weigh in on this important issue.” Senate Republican leaders have vowed not to hold confirmation hearings or an up-or-down vote on any Supreme Court nominee put forward by Obama. “The Leader has been clear: the next president will make this nomination,” Don Stewart, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said in an email Tuesday.

Trump says he could jettison drug czar pick,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he would review a report that his nominee for drug czar championed a law that weakened the government’s ability to fight the nation’s opioid epidemic, and said he could consider jettisoning the pick. “We’re going to look into the report,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Asked if the report had undercut his confidence in his nominee to head the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Representative Tom Marino, Trump said: “I have not spoken to him, but I will speak to him, and I’ll make that determination. “If I think it’s 1 percent negative to doing what we want to do, I will make a change, yes,” he added. Marino’s office did not immediately return a request for comment. The report by the Washington Post and CBS described how Marino introduced and helped push through industry-backed legislation that undercut the Drug Enforcement Administration’s ability to freeze suspicious shipments of pain pills from drug companies.  A number of Democrats called for Trump to abandon his nominee in the wake of the report. “Congressman Marino no longer has my trust or that of the public that he will aggressively pursue the fight against opioid abuse,” Democratic Senator Joe Manchin said in a statement. Manchin’s state of West Virginia has been hit hard by the opioid crisis. In his remarks to reporters, Trump suggested he would be open to changing the law that Marino, a fellow Republican, helped push through and said he would make good on an earlier promise to declare the opioid epidemic a national emergency. “We are going to be doing that next week,” he said, calling the crisis a “massive problem.” Opioids were involved in more than 33,000 deaths in the United States in 2015, the last year of publicly available data, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Overdoses from the category of drugs nearly quadrupled between 1999 and 2015, the CDC said. ",politicsNews,"October 16, 2017 ",0
AN INSIDE LOOK AT OBAMA’S 5-STAR SUMMER VACATION RETREAT: Meanwhile…62% Of Americans Won’t Be Taking A Vacation This Summer,"About 62 percent of Americans say they won t be taking a vacation this summer at all. Out of that, more than half said they couldn t afford it.Just like the Obama s keep telling us  it s all about fair share or something like that As the weather heats up in Washington, DC, the Obamas as planning their summer vacation.The Boston Herald reports that President Barack Obama, first lady Michelle and daughters Sasha and Malia will be staying on Martha s Vineyard from August 8-23.The Obamas have spent almost every single summer on the tony island off the coast of Massachusetts  Cape Cod except for 2012   when the president was running for re-election.Continuing yet another tradition of their annual retreat, the Obamas are also expected to stay at the same $12million  cottage  in Chilmark they rented last year.The 8,100-square-foot home features seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a basketball/tennis court, hot tub, infinity pool and views of the Elizabeth Islands.The home is owned by wealthy widow Joanna Hubschman, whose husband Henry died of cancer in 2011.Four years before his death, Mr Hubschman, a General Electric executive, contributed $6,900   the maximum donation then allowed   to Hillary Clinton s 2008 bid for president, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.However, it was Barack Obama who took the party s ticket and went on to win the White House.Two weeks before the general election, Mr Hubschman contributed $2,300 to Obama s campaign.This year s vacation is likely to be a bit more relaxing for Mr Obama, who faced a wave of criticism for his golf playing last year in the midst of a crisis with ISIS.Via:  UK Daily Mail",left-news,"Jul 7, 2015",1
" Bad News, GOP: Justice Sandra Day O’Connor Backs Obama In Supreme Court Fight","President Obama just received the highest profile supporter for his quest to fulfill his Constitutional duties by nominating a successor to recently deceased Justice Antonin Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court. Retired Justice Sandra Day O Connor, the first woman to serve in that capacity, told an interviewer that Obama is right   America needs a Justice. I don t agree (with Republicans),  O Connor said in an interview with Phoenix-based Fox affiliate KSAZ.  We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it. She noted that it s unusual to for a Supreme Court opening to exist in an election year, saying that the proximity to the presidential race  creates too much talk around the thing that isn t necessary. She said Obama should name a replacement for Scalia, an influential conservative member of the nation s high court who was found dead Saturday at age 79.O Connor also told the station that  you just have to pick the best person you can under these circumstances,  adding,  I wish the president well as he makes choices and goes down that line. The retired justice adds to the slowly growing chorus of voices on the right who have begun to peel off of the original assertion that Obama should not be able to appoint Scalia s replacement. Now some Republicans are closer to the Democratic position, arguing that as has been done in the past, a nomination in the president s final year should not be summarily rejected.O Connor was nominated in 1981 by Ronald Reagan, but while appointed by a conservative president over time she came to be seen as a  swing  justice, never exclusively on one side of an issue.For instance, while she voted in the majority in the Bush v Gore election case in 2000, she also voted with the majority in favor of abortion rights and campaign finance reform.O Connor stepped down from the court in 2005, and was replaced by George W. Bush s nominee, Samuel Alito, a hardcore conservative.Featured image via Twitter",News,"February 18, 2016",1
GUESS WHERE THE BALTIMORE SCHOOL SYSTEM RANKS AMONG THE NATION’S 100 LARGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS?,"Holy smokes! Could someone tell Obama he doesn t need to dump more money into the Baltimore school system. I think they need to point the finger somewhere else The Baltimore school system ranked second among the nation s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil in fiscal year 2011, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.The city s $15,483 per-pupil expenditure was second to New York City s $19,770. Rounding out the top five were Montgomery County, which spent $15,421; Milwaukee public schools at $14,244; and Prince George s County public schools, which spent $13,775.The Census Bureau also noted the first decrease in per-pupil spending nationally since 1977, the year the figures were first tracked.The per-pupil expenditures were calculated based on taking the districts  current spending on day-to-day operations and deducting payments to charter schools and capital funding. The remaining money was divided by the number of students enrolled in traditional schools. The amounts were not adjusted for inflation.Baltimore schools CEO Andr s Alonso said the city s total could have reflected large infusions of cash to the district, including millions in federal stimulus dollars and federal Race to the Top funds.He also credited state lawmakers for maintaining funding. As many states pulled back on spending, with many districts losing funding, Maryland held the line on education, which is why you see three districts at or near the top,  he said.On Monday, the school board passed a $1.2 billion budget that includes per-pupil funding of $5,190. That amount is different from what the Census Bureau reported because the school system takes out other expenses, such as transportation costs and special-education services, before allocating money to individual schools. In addition, the school system provides extra funding for certain groups of students, such as those in special education and dropout-prevention programs.Via: Baltimore Sun",politics,"Apr 30, 2015",1
Senator Grassley to meet Garland despite opposition to nominee ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley has invited Judge Merrick Garland to breakfast, but absent from the menu will be any promise of hearings on President Barack Obama’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. A spokeswoman for Grassley said that the Republican senator spoke with Garland late on Monday and extended the invitation “where they could discuss the nomination and why the Senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office.” The Senate Judiciary Committee is in charge of holding hearings on Supreme Court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full Senate confirmation. Most of the Senate’s 54 Republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of Obama’s, saying the choice should be made by the next president, who would be elected on Nov. 8 and sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017. Despite the wall of Republican opposition to Garland, who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge, Obama and his fellow Democrats continue to push for Senate confirmation this year. Garland already has made several “courtesy calls” to senators, mostly Democrats, and will continue his visits to Capitol Hill this week. If he were to be confirmed, Garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the Feb. 13 death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia - would tilt the Supreme Court to the left for the first time in decades. The race for a replacement for Obama, who is completing his second and final term as president, is in full swing now with billionaire businessman Donald Trump leading two other Republican candidates and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. But it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates.

"Trump denies obstructing FBI probe, says has no tapes of talks with Comey","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he had not obstructed the FBI’s probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and had not recorded his conversations with former FBI chief James Comey. Comey was leading the investigation into allegations Russia tried to sway the election toward Trump and the possibility Trump associates colluded with Moscow when the president fired him on May 9, sparking a political firestorm. “Look there has been no obstruction, there has been no collusion,” Trump told Fox News Channel in an interview set to air on Friday. Fox released a partial transcript of the interview on Thursday. The former head of the Federal Bureau of Investigation testified before a Senate committee that Trump had asked him to drop a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s alleged ties to Russia. Earlier on Thursday, Trump said he did not make and does not possess any tapes of his conversations with Comey, after suggesting last month he might have recordings that could undercut Comey’s description of events. “I have no idea whether there are ‘tapes’ or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings,” Trump wrote on Twitter. Lawmakers investigating allegations of Russian interference in the U.S. election had asked the White House for any such recordings. Shortly after dismissing Comey, Trump mentioned the possibility of tapes in a Twitter post. “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Trump tweeted on May 12. Allegations of ties to Russia have cast a shadow over Trump’s first five months in office, distracting from attempts by his fellow Republicans in Congress to overhaul the U.S. healthcare and tax systems. Trump has privately told aides that the threat of the existence of tapes forced Comey to tell the truth in his recent testimony, a source familiar with the situation said. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said Trump still had questions to answer about possible tapes. “If the president had no tapes, why did he suggest otherwise? Did he seek to mislead the public? Was he trying to intimidate or silence James Comey? And if so, did he take other steps to discourage potential witnesses from speaking out?” Schiff said in a statement. CNN reported on Thursday that two top U.S. intelligence officials told investigators Trump suggested they publicly deny any collusion between his campaign and Russia, but that they did not feel he had ordered them to do so.  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Mike Rogers met separately last week with investigators for special counsel Robert Mueller and the Senate Intelligence Committee, according to CNN.  The two officials said they were surprised at Trump’s suggestion and found their interactions with him odd and uncomfortable, but they did not act on the president’s requests, CNN reported, citing sources familiar with their accounts. Reuters was unable to verify the CNN report. In his interview with Fox, Trump expressed concern about what he described as the close relationship between Comey and Mueller, who was appointed to take over the investigation after Comey was fired. “Well he’s very, very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome,” Trump said, according to the Fox transcript. The Kremlin has denied U.S. intelligence agencies’ conclusion that Moscow tried to tilt the election in Trump’s favor, using such means as hacking into the emails of senior Democrats. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion. ",politicsNews,"June 22, 2017 ",0

"Factbox: Five facts about Mike Pompeo, expected to replace Tillerson","(Reuters) - The following are five facts about Central Intelligence Agency Director Mike Pompeo, who a senior administration official said on Thursday would replace Rex Tillerson as U.S. secretary of state within weeks under a plan developed by the White House.  * Pompeo, 53, regularly briefs President Donald Trump on intelligence matters, and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on North Korea in Trump’s inner circle. * Pompeo has downplayed the extent of Russia’s intervention in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, saying Moscow has sought to influence American elections for decades. * Like Trump, Pompeo is an outspoken critic of Iran and has called for scrapping the 2015 deal curbing Tehran’s nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In October, he said Iran was “mounting a ruthless drive to be the hegemonic power in the region.” * Pompeo has supported the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data. In an opinion piece published last year, he called for restarting the bulk collection of domestic telephone metadata and combining it with financial and lifestyle information into one searchable database. * Before taking the reins at the CIA in January, Pompeo was a conservative Republican member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Kansas. He is a retired Army officer and a graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, and Harvard Law School. ",politicsNews,"November 30, 2017 ",0
"Trump vows to broker Israeli-Palestinian peace, offers no new policies","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to do “whatever is necessary” to broker peace between Israel and the Palestinians as he hosted Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the White House, but gave no sign of how he could revive long-stalled negotiations. In their first meeting, Trump pressed Abbas to do more to stop “incitement to violence” against Israelis and, according to the White House, urged him in private to halt payments to families of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails, a demand long pressed by Israel. Even as Trump boldly predicted he would achieve peace where other presidents had failed, he stopped short of explicitly recommitting his administration to a two-state solution to the decades-old conflict, a long-standing foundation of U.S. policy. Some Palestinians said they were disappointed by the omission. Despite what many experts see as a long-shot bid, Trump told Abbas: “I will do whatever is necessary. ... I would love to be a mediator or an arbitrator or a facilitator, and we will get this done.” Abbas reasserted the goal of a Palestinian state, saying it must have East Jerusalem as its capital with the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.  Most Israelis want all of Jerusalem as their capital and reject a full return to 1967 borderlines as a threat to their security. Trump has faced deep skepticism at home and abroad over the chances for him to achieve any quick breakthrough, not least because his administration has yet to articulate a cohesive strategy for restarting the moribund peace process. Abbas’ White House talks followed a February visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who moved to reset ties after a combative relationship with the Republican president’s predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama.  Trump sparked international criticism at the time, when he appeared to back away from a two-state solution, saying he would leave it up to the parties to decide. Palestinian statehood has been the objective of successive U.S. administrations and the international community. The meeting with Abbas, the Western-backed head of the Palestinian Authority, was another test of whether Trump, in office a little more than 100 days, is serious about pursuing the kind of comprehensive peace deal that eluded his predecessors. Trump insisted he was ready to try to reach the “toughest deal.” But when he later sat down to lunch with the Palestinian leader, he said it was “maybe not as difficult as people have thought over the years.” Trump, who said he decided to “start a process” but offered no new policy prescriptions or timetable, may be underestimating the challenge when trust between the two sides is low, analysts said. “You can’t just pretend you only have to handle a few key issues and that’s it,” said David Makovsky, a member of Obama’s negotiating team during the last talks, which collapsed in 2014. Still, plans are being firmed up for Trump to visit Netanyahu in Jerusalem and possibly Abbas in the West Bank on May 22 and 23, say people familiar with the matter. That has sparked speculation about a meeting of the three. U.S. and Israeli officials have declined to confirm the visit. Trump and Abbas appeared friendly but businesslike as they stood at side-by-side lecterns. But that was a far cry from the way Trump and Netanyahu interacted in February. Abbas promised that under “your courageous stewardship and your wisdom, as well as your great negotiating ability,” the Palestinians would be partners seeking a “historic peace treaty.” But under pressure at home to avoid major concessions, the 82-year-old leader said: “It’s about time for Israel to end its occupation,” referring to Jewish settlements in the West  Bank. Abbas, however, did not repeat in public his demand that Israel freeze settlement construction on land Palestinians want for a state as a condition for negotiations. U.S. lawmakers have warned that Palestinian funding could be cut off unless Abbas halts PLO stipends to families of prisoners whom Israel considers terrorists but many Palestinians see as heroes. There was no indication Abbas, who governs in the West Bank while Hamas militants rule Gaza, bowed to pressure on the issue, especially with hundreds of Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike. In Gaza, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri said the promises Abbas made at the White House “don’t obligate anyone.” Questions have been raised about Trump’s choice of son-in-law Jared Kushner to oversee the peace initiative, along with Trump’s longtime business lawyer, Jason Greenblatt, as envoy. Efforts to enlist Israel’s Sunni Arab neighbors, who share Israeli concerns about Shi’ite Iran, to help rejuvenate peacemaking, have yet to yield results. National security adviser H.R. McMaster described Trump’s foreign policy approach as “disruptive,” saying his unconventional ways could create an opportunity to help stabilize the Middle East. But Trump’s unpredictability has even at times rattled a close ally like Israel. His pro-Israeli campaign rhetoric suggested he might give Netanyahu free rein. But Trump’s promise to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv is on the back burner, and he caught Netanyahu off-guard by asking him to put unspecified limits on settlement activity.

"Blast hits Afghan capital near Shi'ite mosque, killing at least one","KABUL (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility for a suicide attack near a large Shi ite mosque in the Afghan capital on Friday that killed at least one person and wounded five others. The blast hit the Qala-e Fatehullah area of the city, near the Hussainya mosque, and came as security forces were on alert for possible attacks during Ashura, the holiest celebration in the Shi ite religious calendar. President Ashraf Ghani issued a statement saying that the attackers would not be able to shake the unity of the Afghan people with their  inhumane and irreligious  attacks. A statement from Islamic State, which has claimed a string of attacks on Shi ite targets over the past two years, said its fighters had carried out the attack. Afghanistan, a mainly Sunni Islamic country, has mostly avoided the sectarian violence that has devastated countries such as Iraq, but there have been increasing numbers of attacks on Shi ite targets in recent years. Security officials said at least two attackers had been killed as they carried out the operation, apparently intended to hit the mosque, just a month after 20 people were killed during prayers at another Shi ite mosque in Kabul. A hospital run by the Italian aid group Emergency said five wounded had been brought in following the blast but a witness at the scene said eight or nine people had been wounded or killed. The local affiliate of Islamic State has claimed several attacks on Shi ite targets in Kabul in recent years and the government has allowed the Shi ite community to place armed guards near mosques ahead of Ashura. No reliable census information exists on the size of the Shi ite community in Afghanistan, but estimates range around 10-20 percent, with most coming from the Persian-speaking Hazara and Tajik ethnic groups.

Philippines to sanction firms involved in deadly fire if safety skirted,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines said on Tuesday it would investigate whether safety regulations were ignored at an office where a fire killed 37 call center employees, and vowed to impose sanctions if firms had not met standards. The remains of 37 employees of the U.S.-based Research Now SSI killed by Saturday s fire in Davao City have been recovered and a criminal investigation will be launched by the Justice Department. Labour Secretary Silvestre Bello said he had instructed the government s workplace health and safety agency and the Labour Ministry s regional office in Davao, President Rodrigo Duterte s hometown, to investigate if there were lapses in safety standards. The fire broke out at a furniture store on the third level of the 14-year-old New City Commercial Center and quickly engulfed an outsourcing business on the upper floor, based on an initial report from the city government.  We will immediately look into possible violations of some safety and health standards,  Bello told Reuters.  We may not issue any clearance to operate,  he said when asked to clarify sanctions that could be imposed on the mall or call center management if culpable.  Research Now SSI has confirmed 37 of its 500 employees in its Davao call center were  lost  in the fire.  We cannot comment on what is an ongoing investigation,  said Barbara Palmer, company senior vice president for global marketing, in an email in response to a Reuters query on Tuesday about safety protocols at the company s Davao office. On Sunday the firm said in a statement it was helping to support funeral arrangements and would create a fund for contributions for victims  families. The fire is a setback for the Philippines  $23 billion business process outsourcing (BPO) industry, which is an economic lifeline in the country of more than 100 million. The sector employs about 1.15 million people, with jobs forecast to grow to 1.8 million by 2025. Along with remittances from overseas workers, BPO revenues are a major earner of foreign exchange for the country, driving what is one of Asia s fastest-growing economies. The BPO Industry Employees Network (BIEN) has expressed concern about postings on social media that said the building was made of sub-standard materials, had locked its fire exits, and had not held fire drills. It was not possible to immediately check the accuracy of the postings. BIEN said the government should look into every BPO firm s compliance with occupational health and safety standards.  Justice must be served to the victims and those accountable must be penalized so as to avoid future workplace deaths,  BIEN said in a statement. On Monday night, Duterte told relatives of victims that the National Bureau of Investigation, police and fire protection bureau would get to the bottom of the disaster.  The truth will come out,  he said.  Research Now SSI has offices in Texas, California, New York and Toronto and more than 3,500 market research, consulting, media, healthcare and corporate clients. The Call Centre Association of the Philippines (CCAP) said it was waiting for a full report from Research Now SSI, but saw no problem with its members meeting workplace safety standards.  We always comply with government safety regulations because our priority is the welfare of all our employees,  CCAP President Jojo Uligan told Reuters. But the Associated Labour Unions-Trade Union Congress of the Philippines (ALU-TUCP) said safety standards were not being adhered to and the labor department and companies were not living up to their responsibilities to enforce and comply.  This deaths-causing fire could have been minimized to the barest damage to property,  ALU-TUCP spokesman Alan Tanjusay said. ",worldnews,"December 26, 2017 ",0
